The eu said the joint statement after the summit with premier wen wen wen jiabao , the european union , " confirmed its continuing political will to <unk> its efforts to free the embargo " .
The announcement points out that the chinese delegation " welcomes the positive message and believes the message benefits the sound development of the broad strategic partnership between china and the eu " .
When mr wen 's press conference was not at the summit , he said the embargo " failed to reflect the partnership between china and the eu " .

Several eu countries , under france 's <unk> , have pushed the arms off and claimed that the ban has been obsolete .

The acid naturally exists in dark <unk> vegetables , and medicine is known to be an important force of embryo development .
The researchers at the university of <unk> and reagan have been tracking 3000 women , who had taken five milligrams or two milligrams of acid or placebo during the 1980s , and were mostly second and third .
The article published in the british medical journal found that two decades after two years of two , women who had five <unk> acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as a placebo .
The answer is " preliminary . . . . . . . its purpose , " one of the researchers , says <unk> . "
The answer is a very likely outcome , " he says , " and so before we have any conclusions , we must do further scientific research to examine the relevance , if the connection exists . "
The pregnant women , <unk> says , should still take <unk> supplements .
The existing dose advice and " the dose of the experiment is quite a gap , " he says . "
Three times less than 10 times the amount of women who have taken during the study were given each day , according to the british health standards , hoping that women who were pregnant and pregnant in their first stages of pregnancy should take zero <unk> acid per day .
