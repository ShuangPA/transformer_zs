<seg id=1> As we entered the new century, globalization becomes an important and rigorous challenge facing African countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> The leaders of African countries understand more and more clearly that Africa cannot let slip a good opportunity and should rise with spirit to found counter measures. </seg>
<seg id=3> On July 9, 2002, the African Union was formed and has commenced operations.  Since then, on one hand, African countries have been actively promoting the "New Partnership for African Development".  They endeavor to develop their economies and strive to break away from an unfavorable position in globalization.  On the other hand, African countries are exerting great efforts to remove any man-made barriers to the grand mission of an Africa revival -- the armed conflict problem, such as to create a united, peaceful and stable environment. </seg>
<seg id=4> At present, the overall situation in Africa is easing up and hot issues are cooling down.  Different nations are feeling the sense of urgency to end the armed conflict. </seg>
<seg id=5> With the strong support from United Nations and international community, influential regional institutions in Africa, big countries in the regions and even famous politicians are all taking active actions to step up efforts to resolve regional conflict and internal turmoil.  As a result, some prolonged conflict and instability are basically under control. </seg>
<seg id=6> For example, the Democratic Republic Of Congo has formed a national reconciliation government in June last year.  The Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has resolved its coup crisis peacefully in July last year.  The government of Liberia has signed a peace accord with the armed rebels in Accra, capital of Ghana, in August last year.  The Sudan government has held a crucial meeting with the southern-armed rebels in September last year, which was a breakthrough of the deadlock in the peace process.  In October, the different armed and political groups in Somali have held peace talks in Kenya to discuss a nationwide peace process.  In November, Burundi government has signed a peace accord with anti-government rebels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Naturally, stability in the African region is still relatively fragile and the peace fruit still requires further strengthening.  Some potential or actual armed conflicts are still awaiting a final resolution. </seg>
<seg id=8> Meanwhile, the pace of economic development in African countries is still showing a huge gap with that in developing countries in Asia.  This is obviously an unfavorable factor for development in Africa. </seg>
<seg id=9> It obviously requires long-term and arduous efforts from the people of Africa before African countries can effectively deal with the challenges of globalization and realize the dream of an Africa revival. </seg>

<seg id=1> No Signal from ESA's Beagle 2 Probe Since Its Landing on Mars </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, London, 1st) - European Space Agency (ESA) spokesman Bonacina said the U.S. orbiter failed to communicate with the European lander Beagle 2 since its landing on Mars.  The hope to pick up a signal from Beagle 2 is now entrusted to its mother ship, the Mars Express. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "We did not have any progress," said Bonacina. </seg>
<seg id=4> "Right now, we have to put our hopes on the mother ship.  We have to wait for the Mars Express to gather information," he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> U.S. Mars probe, the Odyssey spacecraft, did not pick up any signal from the European Mars probe, Beagle 2, yesterday.  Beagle 2 carries on the mission to search for signs of life on Mars after it separated from Mars Express for a landing on Mars. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Mars Odyssey into Mars orbit for another exploration mission. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The Paris based ESA said the Mars Express, an orbiter built by Europe, has now entered the polar orbit.  It will hopefully transmit some signals back next week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Beagle 2 was scheduled to land on Mars on Christmas Day, but its signal is still difficult to pin down. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> However, the Summit of the Americas remained divided on how to combat spreading poverty in the western hemisphere and the United States failed to get an anti-corruption clause included in the final announcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The free trade zone, which would stretch from Alaska in the north to Argentina in the south, is entitled the world's largest free trade area, with a market of some 800 million people and a gross domestic product of 13-trillion U.S. dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, Argentine President Kirchner criticized the U.S. in his speech at the closing of the two-day summit.  He said a Free Trade Area could not possibly solve the problems of the Americas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Brazil, South America's largest economy, and Venezuela, a key U.S. oil supplier, fought to keep free trade off the summit agenda.  It was only after intense debates that leaders agreed in a declaration to finish negotiating the proposed free trade area of Americas by January 2005. </seg>

<seg id=5> In the Asia Pacific region, North Korea, embraced with its nuclear power, had test-fired several missiles since U.S. started its war on Iraq last month.  The missiles flew over the territorial air space of Japan.

<seg id=1> Today is an important moment inspiring our further advancement in the route of reforms.  We have to give our greatest appreciation to all comrades in our party for their support to the party's willpower and made joint efforts to achieve our reform objective. </seg>
<seg id=2> "Political party's withdrawal from mass media" is the most fundamental requirement for the implementation of a media reform.  The Democratic Progressive Party has always insisted on the concept that ruling can only accelerate the speed of reform but not an obstruction or burden. </seg>
<seg id=3> To promote this reform objective, we also know that all comrades in our party with a pubic position have to take lead and withdraw from media operations.  However, that is only a tiny step in the media reform but it is also a critical step. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> During the martial law era, the mass media was monopolized and many comrades in the party have fought to open up public opinion in media.  They have committed themselves to difficult tasks of organizing the fourth station and other local radio stations etc.  They hoped to use these methods to break through the restrictions at that time and provide more momentum for redevelopment of the media environment. </seg>
<seg id=5> For example, in order to foster the creation of the fourth television station at that time, comrade Trong Chai has put forth a large amount of painstaking efforts and finally the "Formosa Television" was born. </seg>
<seg id=6> His move has a significant impact to the media environment, especially the break-up of the long-time monopoly of the three stations, and created more space for the expansion of the cable television industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> In our process of promoting reforms, we must understand that there are many things we have no choice but to do because of restrictions in history and environment.  As the mass media is completely free and opened today, it signifies that our mission in this phase is completed.  To enable the reform process to continue moving forward, it is necessary for us to make selection and sacrifice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Central Standing Committee has announced that all comrades with a public position must withdraw from media operation before the next legislative session, that is September 5th, in order to set a good example and fulfill the party's undertaking to the people. </seg>
<seg id=9> We are gratified that everyone has taken full consideration of the party's ideal and objective.  Comrades who have made many contributions in the democratic movements, including Trong Chai, Chang Chun-hung, Chou Ching-yu, Hou Shui-sheng, Kao Meng-ting, Hwang Nae-hui and Sung Min-kong etc., have sacrificed their self interest and attach most importance to the promotion of media reform. </seg>

But, we have always been able to turn challenges into momentum for moving forward, leading Taiwan firmly and safely in its efforts for advancing into total democracy and connecting itself with the universal values of democracy, peace, and prosperity. </seg>
<seg id=3> Because we have always believed that people are the masters of our country.  The Democratic Progressive Party's responsibility is to elevate its founding spirit of "clean government, conscientious rule, and love for the homeland" to a bright vision of "reforms, progress, and a good life," laying a foundation of long term peace and stability for the 23 million Taiwanese. </seg>

<seg id=5> Despite Communist China's continual suppression, we have not retreated because destiny is in our hands.  Notwithstanding our lack of bountiful resources, the Democratic Progressive Party has, step-by-step, helped Taiwan expand its international participation and visibility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "Multilateral diplomacy" is the main axis of the Democratic Progressive Party's diplomatic strategy.  In the past year, we have successfully used the "Council on Asian Liberals and Democrats" as a platform to exchange views with other countries and political parties in the region.

<seg id=7> Next March, I will formally assume the chair of the "Council on Asian Liberals and Democrats".  I hope to use the position as a leader of an international organization to find more opportunities for Taiwan to contribute to the international community. </seg>

<seg id=8> In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party has actively participated in the activities of the "Liberal International" since it became a formal member last year. </seg>

<seg id=1> The Taiwan leadership claimed that "for the sake of preventing a military invasion by China and unilaterally change the current status across the Strait, it is necessary to set into action the March 20 peace referendum". </seg>
<seg id=2> This is defamation to Mainland China's peace efforts and provokes the relation between the two sides of the Strait. </seg>
<seg id=3> At present, the real threat to Taiwan safety does not come from the Mainland but originates from Taiwan administration's active pursuit of separation activities in name of "Taiwan independence". </seg>
<seg id=4> The "Taiwan independence" separation force is the direct cause of damage to current relation between two sides of the Strait and endangers the peaceful situation in Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id=5> The Taiwan administration has twisted Mainland's opposition to separation by "Taiwan independence" and Mainland's desire to maintain stability in Taiwan Strait as a suppression of democracy and freedom in Taiwan.  Taiwan has used such an excuse to start the referendum. </seg>
<seg id=6> This is really to make something out of nothing, put right and wrong the other way round. The Taiwan administration is attempting to obtain sympathy and support by cheating such as to continue pushing forward its separation route. </seg>
<seg id=7> The Taiwan administration asserts that they are holding a so-called "preventive referendum" or "peace referendum".  No matter how it is to be packaged, this kind of provocation can only cause confrontation and hostility, escalating the intense relation between the two sides of the Strait, and push the relation between two sides of the Strait to the edge of danger. </seg>
<seg id=8> Taiwan is proceeding in a totally opposite direction with Taiwan compatriots' mainstream public opinion for peace, stability and development.  This is not deepening the Taiwan "democracy" but mislead and manipulate the people of Taiwan.

<seg id=1> Bush's visit to Britain failed to meet his wishes and there are many reasons for that.  The most important one is that U.S. became the sole superpower in the world after the conclusion of the Cold War and it simply turns blind eyes to others as its unilateralism expands. </seg>
<seg id=2> United States has launched the war against Iraq without United Nations authorization.  It shows no respect for the opinions of its main allies on major international issues including, for example, the Iraq reconstruction.

<seg id=5> The United States has grasped Iraq's reconstruction projects tightly in its hand.  The main contracts in the first tender were all given to its own companies and nothing was given to others.  For the dispute over steel, the World Trade Organization has made a ruling that the high U.S. levy is against regulation.  The commerce and industrial sector in Britain hopes that Bush would make some concessions in this trip but in the end, Bush did not clearly declare his stand. </seg>
<seg id=6> Third, United States regards its concept of value as the highest norm, which overrides concepts of all other countries.  It insists to impose democratic reforms in Middle East countries but has encountered reproaches.  Some allies demanded that United States should respect Iraq's Islamic culture and characteristics.

<seg id=2> This is the first time that Japan sends soldiers to a foreign battleground since the end of World War II. </seg>
<seg id=3> It reflects Japan's wish to migrate towards a political and military super power and signifies a change in Japan's defense strategy. </seg>

<seg id=4> The Self-Defense Forces' trip arouses attention because it is not an isolated incident. </seg>
<seg id=5> Japan took the opportunity of the Afghanistan war and made a breakthrough deployment of Self-Defense Forces to a foreign country.  Japan used the Korean Peninsula problem and passed the "War Contingency Laws", which foreshadows the use of force or even preemptive attack by Self-Defense Forces.  Recently, Koizumi's cabinet made preparation for troop deployment to Iraq through "The Basic Plan on Reconstruction in Iraq". </seg>
<seg id=6> One step after another, Japan has finally overcome the restriction of its constitution and succeeded in dispatching soldiers to foreign combat fields. </seg>
<seg id=7> Furthermore, Japan is preparing to amend its "Concept of Basic Defense Force" in 2004 such as to legalize the deployment of Japanese troops to a foreign country and make that a permanent arrangement.  Japan also intends to send "permanent force", which is not temporarily assembled, to overseas countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Meanwhile, the Japanese cabinet has used the so-called "North Korea missile threat" as a reason and decided to commence the deployment of National Missile Defense program from the beginning of 2004.  Japan will import U.S. made "Standard Missile 3" and "Patriot 3" missiles, which can intercept missiles outside and re-entering the earth's atmosphere respectively and thus building a double interception system. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is not difficult to see Japan's Self-Defense Forces are developing the "combined capability of attack and defense" and the so-called "self-defense forces" specializing in "passive defense" will exist in name only. </seg>

<p>

<seg id=8> Koizumi said a formal visit to a shrine on the first day of a new year is Japan's Confucian orthodoxy.  In fact, many people would pay a formal visit to a shrine on that day. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Flu Outbreak in U.S. Reaches New High </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, December 31st (Reporter: Yan Liang) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated on December 31st that the worst flu outbreak not seen in U.S. for 30 years has reached a new high.  Among the 50 states in U.S., 45 of them have reported widespread of flu and the death cases caused by flu are increasing rapidly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> According to the Center's statistics to December 20th, 7.8% of total death cases in America was attributed to flu, which was a record high. </seg>
<seg id=4> At least 42 children have died from flu complications in U.S. and the death cases among adults have also gone up rapidly.  However, it is impossible to have the exact figure at the moment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Experts believed that there are two reasons for the serious outbreak of flu in 2003: first, last year's prevailing "Panama strain A" is no longer the predominant flu virus this year, which renders vaccines made earlier an ineffective protection; second, owing to last year's overproduction in flu vaccines, the two major vaccine producers reduced this year's production to 83 million doses and hence, effectively created a shortage in supply this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The social unrest caused by this flu outbreak is rarely seen despite on average 36,000 people died and about 114,000 people hospitalized for flu-related complications each year in U.S. </seg>
<seg id=7> Mr. William Thompson, a U.S. epidemiologist, believed that this is the worst flu outbreak for U.S. in 30 years.  Flu has come earlier than usual this year and is already widespread in many schools causing long queues in many flu vaccination centers. </seg>
<seg id=8> Under such severe circumstances, U.S. department of health has activated its emergency operations center on December 19th and dispatched teams of health specialists to every state to cope with the situation. </seg>

All regions and departments should strengthen their leadership, operate in close coordination, base on scientific knowledge and in accordance with law, including group prevention and group control.  Authorities should be decisive in actions in order to be highly responsible to the public.  Officials must conscientiously implement the different prevention and control measures.

<seg id=2> U.S. President Reagan has drawn up a list of accusations against the Libyan leader Qadhafi including secret development of nuclear weapons, military interference in foreign countries and terrorism etc. </seg>
<seg id=3> The quarrel between the two sides had finally turned into warfare.  U.S. launched two surgical-type air raids on Libya, code-named "Operation Prairie Fire" and "Operation El Dorado Canyon". </seg>
<seg id=4> Thereafter, U.S. imposed economic sanction on Libya and attacked Libya on the political front, suppressed it in foreign affairs and continued to threaten the country militarily. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, Qadhafi did not give in under the heavy pressure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At present, U.S.-Libya relation has improved.  Some people have given credit to the effect of the Iraq war, which terrorize others by military force, but that might be a biased judgment. </seg>
<seg id=7> In fact, for many years, the peculiar character Qadhafi has been contending U.S. on one hand but on the other hand, he was also throwing branches of the olive tree towards U.S.  Regrettably, Libya has not received any response from U.S. </seg>
<seg id=8> After the Iraq war ended, the different sides in Middle East have adjusted their strategy.  The redistribution of power in the region has provided a turning point for the resumption of diplomatic relation between U.S. and Libya. </seg>

<seg id=1> U.S. has grabbed the early opportunities in modern mass media and monopolizes the rights to speak in a fairly large portion of international news.  Its public opinions and propaganda are reaching out to the whole world; virtually to a level that it can get in by every opening.  And now, why does U.S. bother to put in huge sums to set up a special satellite television station to cover the 22 countries in Middle East? </seg>
<seg id=2> To use the words of the person in charge at "The Free One" television, U.S. is trying to provide Arabian countries with a news platform featuring "fair and all-round viewpoint". </seg>
<seg id=3> Nevertheless, analysts pointed out that "The Free One" is U.S. strategic weapon to permeate into public opinions of Arabian countries.  It is a cultural invasion and a psychological attack plan.  It is U.S. propaganda machine to help push ahead the integration in Middle East and an attempt to reform the policy in Islamic world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Judging from this, "The Free One" has unusual missions.  If we select the most important ones, there are roughly three of them: first, to broadcast the "free concept". </seg>
<seg id=5> U.S. believes the Islamic civilization is a serious obstruction to the promotion of modern civilization by western world.  The extreme religious forces in Islamic countries in Middle East are breeding grounds for international terrorism with an anti-America characteristic.  It is necessary to reform the Islamic world in order for anti-terrorism to be effective.  It is necessary to make the Islamic world recognize and accept western values, living style and political systems. </seg>
<seg id=6> U.S. is attempting to change and influence Arabians unobtrusively and imperceptibly by inculcating its ideology through programs on "The Free One". </seg>
<seg id=7> Second, to improve the image of United States. </seg>
<seg id=8> U.S. is adopting unilateralism in its foreign affairs.  In a series of international issues, U.S. has been inordinately proud of its strength and persists in its own way.   Its high-handed actions have caused resentment and complaints from Arabian countries and the Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id=9> Since the "September 11" incident, America's consistent undue favor for Israel has intensified its contradiction with the Islamic world in Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=10> U.S. has used anti-terrorism and elimination of mass destruction weapon as an excuse and invaded Iraq without any concrete evidence or authorization from United Nations.  Its act has provoked strong resentment from the Muslim public. </seg>

Suddenly, a new light shines into the eyes of those who have been watching the South Asia situation for a long period of time. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> First, the timetable agreed in the meeting is feasible and both sides have not only confirmed the specific schedule and topics for meeting but also assigned levels to different talks in accordance with the importance of the topic involved. </seg>

This time, the dialogue will use a "step-by-step" model.  Talks will start from a low level and gradually move to higher levels such as to make sufficient preparation for dialogue at senior level. </seg>
<seg id=8> In addition, after the several ups and downs in bilateral relation between the two countries, both sides are now in unanimity that war is not a good solution for problems and one should better stay away from it.

<seg id=1> Since the "September 11" incident, U.S. President Bush has introduced the "preemptive strike" policy in June 2002.  The policy was applied in U.S. foreign affairs and the first "preemptive strike" war took place in March last year against Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=2> The concept of "preemptive strike" directly contradicts the core principle of "respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other" in international law.  Moreover, it has the danger that others may copy and follow this principle and thus causing new instability in international order. </seg>

<seg id=1> Recently, a lot of international public opinions commented on U.S. current policy on Africa. </seg>
<seg id=2> An article entitled the "Africa Policy Outlook 2004", published in the January 2004 issue of "Foreign Policy in Focus" in U.S., believe the foreign policy of Bush administration has brought forth negative impacts directly and indirectly to Africa.  U.S. continues to fully focus on the war against terrorism and the problem of proliferation in weapon of mass destruction.  In particular, U.S. is tied up in Iraq and cannot afford to give too much attention to Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Many of us still recall the Bush administration has established the "President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief" in January last year to express care for Africa and undertook to provide a minimum of US$3 billion a year to Africa. </seg>
<seg id=4> In July last year, Bush visited the five African countries of Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria and has promised various assistance to Africa, including US$15 billion for the prevention and control of AIDS, another US$100 million to combat terrorist activities in Africa, emergency food relief and education assistance program etc. </seg>
<seg id=5> These assistance programs were once welcomed by African countries and won numerous praises from international community. </seg>
<seg id=6> Nevertheless, U.S. has not proceeded with any specific implementation in the past one-year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> But, Africa is in urgent needs. </seg>
<seg id=8> After we moved into the new century, Africa is facing numerous challenges in its development.  The "African Union" was formed to coordinate the affairs of the whole continent such as to achieve the "Development Objective for 21st Century" devised by United Nations in 2000, which calls for reduction in hunger, poverty and to promote health care and education.  The "New Partnership for African Development" was also laid down to promote development in nations but development capital funds are in serious shortage because of the fragile economic base. </seg>
<seg id=9> The United Nations have urged many times for developed countries to use 0.7% of their gross domestic products as official aids to least developed countries. </seg>

<seg id=1> Recently, the public opinions in Europe are exploring a popular topic -- is the meeting of the "three magnates", German chancellor Schroeder, French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair, gradually becomes some kind of mechanism? </seg>
<seg id=2> Public opinions called the "three magnates" the "three new carts" of European Union and the relation between the three countries as the "new triangle". </seg>
<seg id=3> The "new triangle" is a new thing and what course it is going to take remains to be seen.  However, no matter judging from any angle, the "new triangle" appears to have an overall benefit to the process of uniting Europe.  Hence, it may benefit Europe to be a pole in the world's multi-polarization pattern and also for Europe to play a more important role in the international stage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A review of European history for the past hundred years tells us a fundamental characteristic of the triangular relation between Germany, France and Britain: the alliance of Britain and France to restrict or resist Germany. </seg>

<seg id=6> During the Cold War, East and West Germany were separated as a member in the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization respectively. </seg>
<seg id=7> After the Cold War, the united Germany became much stronger than before and caused an imbalance of power in Western Europe.  France became suspicious and for a certain time, the "Germany-France axle" ceased to rotate.  This caused France to move closer to Britain with an intention to contain Germany. </seg>
<seg id=8> In recent years, the "Germany-France axle" has fired up again but the drastic clashes between unilateralism and multi-polarization in the world has pushed European Union into a serious spilt on the Iraq issue: </seg>
<seg id=9> The "old Europe" led by Germany, France and the "new Europe" led by Britain, Poland adopted totally opposite stands in the Iraq war problem. </seg>

<seg id=2> Making use of this opportune time, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games held a series of educational activities to promote advance literacy and popularized the knowledge about the Olympic games. </seg>
<seg id=3> Among these activities, the publication of a textbook targeted at young readers, entitled "Learn More About the Olympic Games for High School Students", is an important achievement. </seg>
<seg id=4> The textbook is excellent in both pictures and literary compositions.  It employs the story-telling approach to make lively and systematic introductions about the Olympic games and the essence of its spirit.

<seg id=5> Last year, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games has also specially designed a timetable for young students, which was made by recycled papers with the Beijing Olympic logo imprinted on it. </seg>
<seg id=6> The theme of "Green Olympics" is to prepare and host the Olympic games in accordance with sustainable development concepts, including environmental protection and ecological balance. </seg>
<seg id=7> Just like setting time for lessons, we hope that the timetable can set a standard to the behavior of young students and gradually render them a supporter and promoter of "Green Olympics". </seg>

<seg id=2> The core content is to greatly improve the quality of the environment in our capital -- create a graceful environment for the Olympic games and build an ecological city. </seg>
<seg id=3> To achieve this end, Beijing has to adopt a wide range of technology and measures to protect the environment.  It is necessary to promote large-scale environmental treatment in every way, including forestation in city and rural areas; development of environmental protection industries; enhance conscious of the society in environmental protection; and encourage active public participation in different activities to improve the ecological environment. </seg>
<seg id=4> It is important to do a good job in the implementation of "Green Olympics" in order to push ahead an all-round, coordinated and sustainable development in Beijing's economy and society.  This carries through the assertion in the 16th Communist Party Congress for the establishment of a people-oriented, all-round, coordinated and sustainable scientific development. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, January 8 (Reporter: Li Nanling and Hong Wen) - In order to protect public health and prevent transmission of the contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) into and out of Shenzhen, the Shenzhen Municipal Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (SMIQB) issued a statement a few days ago and decided to implement universal health and quarantine measures on all drivers entering and exiting the three land ports at Huanggang, Wenjindu (Man Kam To) and Shatoujiao (Sha Tau Kok) starting from the 9th.  Drivers have to fill out a health and quarantine declaration form and their body temperature will also be taken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> It is understood that practical difficulties do exist at Shenzhen because of the vast number of vehicles entering and exiting the ports.  There are on average 25,000 vehicle-times crossing Huanggang and close to 10,000 vehicle-times at Wenjindu.  It is not so easy to keep traffic flowing smoothly and yet, enforces health inspections on all drivers at the same time. </seg>
<seg id=4> SMIQB has overcome many difficulties in order to perfect the job of taking body temperature, collecting and checking health declaration forms.  Apart from an internal transfer that helped place more hands on the front line, SMIQB also urgently recruited an additional 250 staffs and put them through intensive training.  The new recruits will be deployed to strengthen the front line of ports to ensure smooth and safe traffic at the ports.  At the same time, the bureau also purchased an additional 60 portable high-performance infrared thermal detectors to satisfy the workload. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> SMIQB has requested the attention of all relevant units and drivers crossing the border that the "Entry and Exit Health Inspection and Quarantine Card" is obtainable from the same location where drivers renew their "Vehicle and Cargo (Personnel) Entry - Exit Inspection and Quarantine Control Book", or at the spot where body temperature and the health declaration forms are collected and checked. </seg>
<seg id=6> The bureau appealed to all relevant units and driver crossing the border for positive cooperation in order to perfect this job.  Public health can only be protected when solid measures are taken to prevent the transmission of SARS into and out of the Shenzhen ports. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Archaeological Discovery) 31 Qin Tombs Found at Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, China </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 15 (Reporter: Tiema) - In the past, historians believed that the palace area at Nantou village of Sun Family, Fengxiang County, Baoji City, Shaanxi Province became an important sacrificial graveyard of Qin royal family only after Qin state moved the capital city to Yong Town.  However, Shaanxi Archaeological Institute has accidentally found 31 Qin tombs at the palace area a few days ago, which might change this belief. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In order to satisfy the request of a company in Baoji City to build a factory at the site of the ruins, the Shaanxi Archaeological Institute conducted an archaeological exploration of the vicinity.  The company was in urgent need of about 20,000 square meters of land but the Institute found 31 Qin tombs of Western Zhou to Chunqiu period right inside that area. </seg>
<seg id=4> After Shaanxi Yong Town Archaeological team performed further digging and cleared up the ancient tombs, they found 40 bronze and pottery relics. </seg>
<seg id=5> One of the Qin tombs has an outer coffin and two inner coffins.  There is also a sacrificial bury of two horses by the side of the tomb. </seg>
<seg id=6> Inside this tomb, 15 bronze and pottery relics were unearthed.  The bronze relics included dings (a three-legged ancient Chinese cooking vessel), pots and axes etc. </seg>
<seg id=7> Among these relics, the bronze dings had very elegant craving on them and demonstrated sophisticated craftsmanship.  These relics help reveal the style of bronze casting during Western Zhou period. </seg>
<seg id=8> Judging from the sacrificial objects, the tomb probably belonged to a Qin duke of late Western Zhou period. </seg>
<seg id=9> Based on this finding, experts speculated that there might be a large group of ancient tombs in nearby area. </seg>
<seg id=10> This accidental discovery has a lot of value in the studies of the relocation of capital in Qin Dynasty and the overall layout of Yong Town in Qin and Han periods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to introduction by Tian Yaqi, Assistant Researcher of Shaanxi Archaeological Institute and team leader of Yong Town Archaeological Team, historians have long believed that the palace area at Nantou village of Sun Family became an important sacrificial graveyard of Qin royal family in Qin and Western Zhou period only after the Qin state moved capital to Yong Town. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) U.S. Starbucks Heading for Paris, the "Capital of Coffee" </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 15 - U.S. coffee chain store, Starbucks, opened its first store in Paris, the so-called "world capital of coffee" on the 15th.  Starbucks is determined to add at least 10 shops in France this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> During the opening ceremony of the new store at Paris' Opera district, an area with plenty of cafes, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Schultz said Starbucks never dared to offer to teach the French how to sip coffee.  Starbucks did not have the slightest intention to steal business from local cafes.  Starbucks only wants to introduce to the French people its only understanding of the coffee culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Starbucks chose the Opera district in Paris as its top choice because the section is full of office workers and tourists. </seg>
<seg id=5> In addition, Starbucks plans to open a store in the Montparnasse district, a popular area for cultural workers, and also another one in the La Defense district, home to many multinationals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In France, the American food and beverage culture has been subjected to some discrimination throughout history. </seg>
<seg id=7> However, McDonald and Kentucky Chicken still achieved great success in France and became one of the favored foreign foods alongside with Arabian, Japanese and Chinese foods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Seattle based Starbucks has opened 7,000 chain stores in more than 30 countries. </seg>
<seg id=9> Judging from outside the store, the new store looks more like a McDonald fast food outlet than a European cafe. </seg>
<seg id=10> In France, Starbucks will serve customers with both paper and porcelain cups. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 17 - On the 16th, the joint ocean salvage team of France and Egypt recovered a black box from a jetliner that crashed into the Red Sea.  Thereafter, the team found the second black box of the crashed plane on the 17th at the deep bottom of sea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The head of the Egyptian salvage team, Hamdi Sami, said the French "Scorpio" robot submarine was trying to recover the second black box, which was used to record sounds in the cockpit.  It is estimated that the box can be brought to surface on the morning of 18th (local time). </seg>
<seg id=4> The two black boxes were found at a depth of 1,000 meters and they were about 30 meters apart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Shaker Qilada, head of the Egyptian investigation team, said the first black box had recorded all kinds of technical data prior to the crash.  The box will be handed to a laboratory of Egyptian Civil Aviation for "decoding and analysis". </seg>

<seg id=1> China: Breakthrough in Cryo-Preservation at Ultra-Low Temperature and Replantation of a Severed Finger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 18 (Reporter: Su Wanming) - China succeeded in the replantation of a severed finger, which was preserved using liquid nitrogen at the ultra-low temperature of -196 degree Celsius. </seg>
<seg id=3> A scholar in China announced a few days ago an important breakthrough in ultra-low temperature cryo-preservation and replantation of a severed finger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A few days ago, the Department of Hand and Foot Surgery at Shandong Provincial Hospital had once again replanted a severed finger successfully for a patient (the severed finger was preserved by liquid nitrogen at ultra-low temperature of -196 degree Celsius for 5 days).  This is the second surgery by the hospital since its first successful replantation of a severed finger last year (preserved in liquid nitrogen at ultra-low temperature of -196 degree Celsius for 81 days). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Health Department's consultation report on new technology in medicine and medical treatment has confirmed that these are the only two cases in the world of a successful replantation of a severed finger after cryo-preservation at ultra-low temperature. </seg>

Some economists forecasted that United States would be the biggest winner on the continual weakness of the U.S. currency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The majority of the economists at the meeting believed that U.S. officials, including Secretary of United States Department of Treasury John Snow, appeared to have abandoned the "strong dollar" policy in recent years. </seg>
<seg id=4> A weak dollar can provide greater economic development opportunities and creates more jobs, a point most obvious in the manufacturing industry. </seg>
<seg id=5> At the same time, the devaluation of the U.S. unit renders U.S. products more competitive in domestic and foreign markets, which in turn can help reduce U.S. trade deficit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> However, economists also believed the weak dollar would bring forth negative impacts to U.S. </seg>
<seg id=7> First, U.S. stock market may continue to track at a low level as the value of different types of investment fall.  Overseas investors may withdraw their money as they worry about further devaluation of the dollar.  Second, the cost of imports becomes more expensive, which will eventually lead to erosion of the standard of living in America.  Third, a massive devaluation might trigger instability in international trade and finance. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=8> In addition, the dollar devaluation also brings forth more serious impact to Europe, Japan and Canada. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) WTO Sends Dispute on "Byrd Subsidy" to Arbitration </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 26 (Reporter: Li Jie) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on the 26th that it called for a ruling by an arbitration institution regarding the European Union and seven other WTO members' demand for sanctions against the United States over the "Byrd Subsidy" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The demand for sanctions was filed because United States failed to eradicate the "Byrd Amendment" within the time limit stipulated by WTO. </seg>
<seg id=4> U.S. Congress passed the "Byrd Amendment" in 2000, which obliges the U.S. government to distribute revenue from punitive duties on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases directly to U.S. companies that were harmed, rather than sending the revenue to U.S. Treasury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> European Union, Japan, and other major U.S. trade partners opposed the U.S. method. </seg>
<seg id=6> WTO finally decided in January 2003 that the Amendment violated global trade regulations and demanded U.S. to abolish it before December 27 of that year. </seg>
<seg id=7> However, U.S. did not comply with the WTO ruling. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Recently, European Union, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India, South Korea, Mexico and Chile applied to WTO for an approval to levy additional import tariffs on some U.S. products up to the equivalent amount of U.S. subsidy. </seg>

<seg id=3> According to the bill, children of immigrants that are born in Denmark will not have the right of automatic citizenship. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The proposal is the latest of a series of restrictive immigration measures introduced by the Denmark government since Rasmussen, leader of Liberal party, took up the office as Prime Minister in November 2001. </seg>
<seg id=5> According to reports, the bill is likely to be adopted by parliament because the Liberal party has the support of the right wing Danish People's Party on the issue of immigrants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The bill requires children of foreigners born in Denmark to present naturalization application when they turn adults, just like any other immigrant.  They will not have automatic citizenship. </seg>
<seg id=7> Naturalized immigrants will be stripped of Danish citizenship if they commit serious crimes against society. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id=3> Several months before these incidents, another several hundred people have died in Chongqing natural gas pipe blowout, several fuel gas explosions in coalmines and other frequent serious traffic accidents. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> China is a vast country and densely populated.  Hence, the probability of a disaster is higher than other countries and several dozens or even several hundred people could easily be killed in any accident.  Objectively, this is a reality that has no way out. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> According to statistics, a total of 99 maids of different nationalities fell to death from buildings during January 1999 to June 2003. </seg>
<seg id=3> Behind these numbers are broken families that can no longer wait for the return of a daughter or a mother.  These are misfortunes that could be avoided.  Hence, it is definitely the direction of our efforts and we must strive to lower the number of such regrets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to a public notice released recently by the Indonesian embassy, 96 Indonesian maids have died since 1999 while working in Singapore and some of them were fallen to death from high-rise buildings. </seg>

<seg id=1> Mainland China's world-renowned Taiwan expert Chen Kongli has recently published a new book, entitled "Taiwan Observation". </seg>
<seg id=2> The book included articles mostly written after the first rotation of political party in Taiwan up till Chen Shui-bian's proposal of "one country on each side".  These are the author's observation and thoughts about Taiwan's internal situations and cross-strait relation during the period of "listen to what he [Chen] says and observe his moves". </seg>

<seg id=3> Articles written two years ago can only be published two years later.  This clearly reflects China's complicated steps in the review and examination of research articles concerning Taiwan.  The lengthy process further illustrates the "Taiwan Observation" is difficult to come by. </seg>

<seg id=1> In Taiwan's evening election rallies, different camps usually use tourist buses to pick up a large mass of people to the campaign site.  However, the recent trend is that evening rallies of Bian-Lu have become quieter than those of Lien-Soong. </seg>
<seg id=2> Not long ago, Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian held a campaign rally in a certain northern city.  He was shouting "Dong Suan (homonym of 'win an election')" but about half of the crowd in front of the stage did not follow him -- it turns out that most of the crowd have friends invested in Mainland China but the three direct links are delayed again and again; the economic policy does not produce results and many feel uncomfortable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> If there is no accident, judging from different signs ranging from public survey to illegal betting over the election result, the defeat of Chen-Lu pair can be presumed as the presidential election enters the phase of final countdown. </seg>
<seg id=4> Unless there is an outburst of some explosive circumstances, for example, the Pan-Blue Coalition has a major spilt or even more embarrassing scandal, otherwise Chen Shui-bian, who came to power through secret support of Lee Teng-hui, has proven incapable of wining enough support from the public over the past four years.  In fact, the confidence of Pan-Green supporters was weakened because the Pan-Green Coalition has continuously exposed their inadequacy in the black gold corruption and a series of no-taste roles or performance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> How should Beijing look at the situation where Pan-Blue Coalition may regain power again? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> First, we should understand the Pan-Blue Coalition that may regain power is no longer controlled solely by Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) but a combination of Kuomintang and the People First Party.  There will be problems of internal tradition and collaboration with local parties. </seg>
<seg id=7> The current close cooperation during the election period may not necessarily indicate the relation in future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> If they do win the election, they are going to need a lot of time for internal reorganization in order to face the legislative election following heel at the end of the year.  This means it is difficult for the Lien-Soong regime to make any important changes to the cross-strait relation. </seg>
<seg id=9> Unless they can recognize the improvement of cross-strait relation can help gain some bonus points in Taiwan internal politics and are confident that they can create fruitful results in a short period of time.  In any event, the most important thing is to be able to let the people of Taiwan taste that fruitful result. </seg>

<seg id=3> Washington authorities strengthened inspections of foreign tourists when worries about flight security were sharply increasing recently. Over the past week, such worries have led to the temporary cancellation of several flights from and to the United States. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Homeland Security Department, which is responsible in implementing the US Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) plan, pointed out that citizens from most of Europe's 28 countries were free from these procedures. </seg>

<seg id=3> Speaking on his way to Chong Wa Dae for a cabinet meeting, South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan told reporters: "I hope the meeting will be held at least in the first half of this year." </seg>

<seg id=1> Liberia's Largest Rebel Group Sees Deeper Rift in Command </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP report from Monrovia, January 12) After the expulsion of Conneh, leader of "Liberians United Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD)", the struggles for the command of Liberia's largest rebel group have intensified. One rebel leader has firmly claimed that Conneh was still in power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> LURD rose up against former president Taylor's government in 1999, sparking a four-year civil war in Liberia, and gaining control of some 4/5 of Liberia's territory. </seg>
<seg id=4> In mid-August last year, Taylor agreed to go to Nigeria in exile, paving the way for the western African country to reach a reconciliation and power-sharing agreement. The former government and the rebels as well as the opposition parties formed a transitional government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, a LURD clique that calls itself "top military command" has accused Conneh of selling posts in the transitional governments for his own profits and announced recently that they supported Conneh's ex-wife, Aisha Keita Conneh, to replace Conneh as the new leader. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> But Dweh, the current transitional parliament speaker and founder of LURD, firmly insisted that LURD's National Executive Committee had the sole power to sack the group's leaders. </seg>
<seg id=7> He told the media the night before yesterday: "I founded LURD in Nigeria and I can ensure the Liberian people that there is no split in LURD and nothing can impair the peace process." </seg>
</p>

<seg id=8> Dweh has attributed LURD's rift to the behind-the-scene maneuvers by the transitional government leader Bryant and other senior leaders in the transitional government. </seg>
<seg id=9> Businessman Bryant was named to lead the war-torn country to a general election in 2005. </seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP report from Paris, January 17) Up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters held a demonstration in Paris to protest against the new generation of reactors, accusing the police of bringing about troubles by allowing another demonstration against a ban on religious headscarves in schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The anti-nuclear protesters' main target was the European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPWR), the first of which is to be built in Finland by a consortium including the French state-owned Areva group and German engineering giant Siemens at a cost of three billion euros (3.7 billion dollars). </seg>

<seg id=5> In terms of the Asian Pacific region, since the United States launched the war against Iraq, North Korea, which is armed with nuclear weapons, has tested its missiles several times to fly over Japan's territorial air space; In addition, China has long been actively building up its military strength and has deployed missiles targeting at Taiwan. </seg>

<seg id=1> Today is an important moment to encourage us to keep moving forward on the road of reform. We greatly affirm the fact that all the party comrades are able to show the party's will to make joint efforts to reach the reform objectives. </seg>
<seg id=2> "The withdrawal of parties from the media organizations of radio and TV" is the basic requirement in implementing media reform and it is also the firm will of the Democratic Progressive Party. Ruling will only speed up the reform process instead of becoming a hindrance or a burden. </seg>
<seg id=3> We also know that to achieve the objectives, it is a small but a key step in media reforms for party comrades, who hold public service posts, to take the lead in withdrawing from media operations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the past when there were curfews and a media monopoly, in an effort to create more open public opinions, many party comrades had devoted themselves to the arduous task of setting up the fourth station and local radios in a bid to break the then restrictions and inject more momentum for reforming the media environment through this way. </seg>
<seg id=5> For example, Comrade Cai Tong-rong had devoted much effort for the establishment of the fourth TV station, thus giving birth to the "People's TV". </seg>
<seg id=6> The move exerted great influence on the whole media environment. It, in particular, broke the long-term monopoly by the three stations and created more space for the development of cable TV stations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> However, we must understand that due to limitations of the historical environment, many practices were taken because they could not be otherwise in order to push forward the reforms. So, today when the media environment is totally open and free, the mission of the last stage has been fulfilled. To push forward the reform process, it is a must for us to determine what to keep and what to give up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Central Standing Committee has announced that all the party comrades, who hold public service posts, should withdraw from the media operations when the Legislative Council begins its next session on September 5 to set an example of keeping the promise for the people. </seg>
<seg id=9> We are very gratified that all members are able to keep in mind the party's aspirations and objectives, including those comrades who contributed a lot during the democratic movement, such as Cai Tong-rong, Zhang Jun-hong, Zhou Qing-yu, Hou Shui-sheng, Gao Meng-ding, Huang Nai-hui and Shen Ming-gong. They are all able to give up their own interests and attach more importance to promoting media reforms. </seg>

<seg id=2> Despite of the frustrations or ups and down during the administration of the Democratic Progressive Party, we have always been able to convert challenges into a driving force to move forward and stably lead Taiwan to establish the structures for deepening its democracy in line with the world's common values of democracy, peace and prosperity. </seg>
<seg id=3> Because we have long been holding that people are the masters of the country, the Democratic Progressive Party's responsibility is hence to sublime its founding spirit of "Honest and Upright, Diligent Administration, Loving Homeland" to a brighter vision of "Reform, Progress and Good Life", and to lay a foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the 23 million Taiwan people. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> "Multilateral Diplomacy" has been the core of Democratic Progressive Party's overall diplomatic strategy. Over the past year, based on the platform of the "Asian Free Democratic Alliance", we have successfully shared experiences and conducted party exchanges with countries in the region regarding such topics as economic challenges in the East Asian region, democratic reforms of parties, elimination of money politics, settlement of globalization and poverty issues, political publicity and communication as well as the youth's participation in politics. </seg>
<seg id=7> I will assume the post of Chairman of "Asian Free Democratic Alliance" next March. I expect to use the capacity as a leader of an international organization to create more opportunities for Taiwan to contribute to the international community. </seg>

<seg id=8> In addition, since the Democratic Progressive Party became a formal member of "the International Free Alliance" last year, it has been actively engaged in relevant affairs of the organization. </seg>

<seg id=2> To evaluate the work of the Consumers' Rights Association, it is better to see whether consumers' rights have been substantially improved. </seg>
<seg id=3> I fully agree with what Chairman Chen said just now. Over the past 30 years, not only the consumers have become aware of their own rights, all walks of life are paying more attention to consumer rights as well. This is the result of efforts made by the Consumers' Right Association and the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Consumers' Right Association conducts regular tests on products, carries out market investigations and research of industrial operations regarding various products and services, and issues just and objective market information to the public through the monthly magazine "Choices". </seg>
<seg id=5> The monthly magazine "Choices" has won the deep trust of the residents. The current Internet edition of "Choices" will give full play to its functions and will help consumers get quick access to market information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The Consumers' Rights Association has 11 regional consumer consulting centers and 16 hot lines to offer consumers information about relevant products and services and accept their complaints. </seg>
<seg id=7> Since its establishment, the Consumers' Rights Association has received an increasing number of inquires, from thousands of cases in 1970s when it was first established to 146,000 cases last year, an increase by 20 times. This shows that more and more consumers will refer to the reports and comments issued by the Consumers' Rights Association before they choose products and services. </seg>
<seg id=8> In addition, the Consumers' Rights Association handled more than 26,000 complaint cases this year. </seg>
<seg id=9> The Consumers' Rights Association occasionally criticizes individual tricky shops by name, which not only help prevent consumers from being cheated, but also aims to throw a scare into the business operators. </seg>

<seg id=2> In this respect, the government and I have been making improvements over the past 6 to 7 months. We have noticed that what the residents asked was for us to build a good economy and handle the issue of people's well-being. We have made a lot of efforts in this regard. The residents have a lot of complaints about the 23rd Article of the "Basic Law", so we have revoked the 23rd Article. In fact, the government has given an instant response. </seg>

<seg id=5> What are the basic issues? </seg>
<seg id=6> These are issues concerning the principles. Some are legal issues concerning the relevant provisions of the "Basic Law" that are subject of our political self-criticism. How to understand it exactly is to first have this work well done. </seg>
<seg id=7> We are doing this work right now. A three-member team has begun doing this job. </seg>

<seg id=7> As the saying goes, "a whole year's work depends on a good start in spring". I hope all members in the gold and silver trade circle will continue to make efforts next year to grasp the "golden time" of the gold and silver business, seize the opportunity of a rise in gold demand brought by the mainland's gold market reforms, China's accession into the WTO and implementation of CEPA, and continually push forward market development. </seg>
<seg id=8> I believe with the active efforts by people of the our trade, Hong Kong's gold market will become more splendid. </seg>

<seg id=6> There is a reason as to why it has been possible to see the widespread use of advanced and practical technologies in agriculture, the emerging of rural enterprises and the large movement of surplus rural labor forces to costal regions and urban areas. A fundamental cause is the solid basis of hundreds of millions of rural labor who have received compulsory education. The popularization of compulsory education in rural areas has been very fruitful and cannot be ignored. </seg>
<seg id=7> Currently, our country's agricultural and rural economic development has come to a critical stage. An overall improvement of the quality of the rural labor force is urgently needed for developing a high-quality, high efficiency, environmentally friendly and safe agriculture, for expansion of rural industrial business operations and for movement of surplus rural labor forces. </seg>
<seg id=8> The emergence of the world's new scientific and technological revolution and the drive for building a better-off society have raised a higher demand on the rural population with respect to the quality in such areas as science and technology, culture, ideology and ethics. </seg>
<seg id=9> Without the comprehensive "Nine-Year Compulsory Education" and the overall improvement of the farmers' quality, the target of a fully better-off society is hard to reach. </seg>

<seg id=1> The Iraqi Temporary Governing Council and the US occupation authority have recently signed an agreement, announcing a timetable for returning power to Iraq in stages by next June. </seg>
<seg id=2> The agreement has been barely accepted by the international community. Although the EU's foreign minister meeting welcomed the agreement, France said "the process is too slow". While "inspired" by the power transfer plan, UN Secretary General Annan said that UN's role in Iraq was "premature". Russia has cast doubts on the legitimacy of the agreement. </seg>
<seg id=3> The Iraqi people have a cold response. The US media even believe that "this is a big gamble". </seg>
<seg id=4> All in all, people have cast doubts on it and would rather wait and see. </seg>

<seg id=5> It's not without reason that the international community has great doubts on it. </seg>

<seg id=1> The US government announced on November 18th that it had decided to impose quota restrictions on three Chinese textile export products, including textile cloth, bras and robes. </seg>
<seg id=2> It is very regrettable that the US government's trade protectionist move came as China was making continuous efforts to expand Sino-US bilateral economic and trade cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Under the current economic globalization, it is very inappropriate for the US to reset quotas on Chinese textile exports. </seg>
<seg id=4> Firstly, such abuse of "quotas" hinders the implementation of WTO's free trade principle. </seg>
<seg id=5> While advocating "free trade" on one hand, it has frequently resorted to the "quota" on the other hand to rebuild a trade barrier. Doesn't this seem too arbitrary and unfair? </seg>
<seg id=6> Secondly, the "quota" has curbed the good momentum of the Sino-US economic and trade development. </seg>
<seg id=7> Since China and the US reached agreement on China's accession into the WTO in 1999, the US exports to China have seen an average rise of 15% annually. </seg>

<seg id=1> Bush's failure to reach his targets during his visit to Britain has many causes, the most important of which is that after the end of the Cold War, the US has become the world's sole superpower, disregarding anyone else under its swelling unilateralism. </seg>
<seg id=2> The US launched the war against Iraq without UN authorization and has showed no respect to its allies' advice on major international issues including Iraq's reconstruction. Its stubbornness has aroused widespread resentment. </seg>
<seg id=3> A recent poll issued by the European Commission showed that 68% of EU's citizens held that the US did not have sufficient reasons to launch the war against Iraq while 53% believed that the US posed threats to the world's peace. </seg>
<seg id=4> Secondly, the US stresses anti-terrorism and expects its allies to provide personnel and funds while turning a blind eye to their concerns. </seg>
<seg id=5> The US is holding tightly in hands Iraq's reconstruction projects and has offered the first contract bids to domestic companies, unwilling to share with others. In the steel trade dispute, the WTO has ruled that the US high tariffs are against its regulations. The British business and industrial sectors had expected Bush to make some concessions during his visit but he failed to respond to the request. </seg>
<seg id=6> Thirdly, the US regards its values as the top ones and has imposed them on other countries. It insists on carrying out democratic reforms in the Middle East countries, which has drawn oppositions. Some allied countries have asked the US to respect Islamic nations' culture and unique characteristics, believing that one of the causes that has led to US army's being bogged down in Iraq is the bitter pill of its "disrespect". </seg>

<seg id=1> Following half a year's debate, an advance team of Japan's Self-Defense Force was eventually deployed to Iraq at the end of 2003. </seg>
<seg id=2> This was the first time that Japan has deployed troops in an overseas battlefield since the end of the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id=3> It reflects Japan's will of becoming a political and military power and also symbolizes the change of Japan's defense strategies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The deployment of the Self-Defense Force has attracted great attention, as it is not an isolated incident. </seg>
<seg id=5> Japan has used the opportunity of the war in Afghanistan to make a breakthrough of deploying the Self-Defense Force abroad. It has made use of the issue of the Korean Peninsular to adopt the "Emergency Legislation" to foreshadow the Self-Defense Force's use of force and even launching preemptive attacks. Koizumi's cabinet has recently passed "the Basic Plan of Supporting Iraq's Reconstruction", which has foreshadowed sending troops to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=6> Step by step, it has eventually broken the restrictions imposed by Japan's Peaceful Constitution and sent troops to overseas battlefields. </seg>
<seg id=7> In addition, Japan is also seeking to amend "the Conception for Basic Defense Forces" in 2004 to legalize and perpetuate overseas military deployment and plans to set up a "permanent troop" for overseas deployment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Meanwhile, citing the so-called "North Korean missile threats", the Japanese cabinet meeting has decided to deploy a missile defense system at the beginning of 2004, introducing the US "Standard-3 Missile" and the "Patriots-3 Missile" to intercept outer atmosphere missiles and missiles returning to the atmosphere, building a double missile interception network. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is not hard to see that Japan's Self-Defense Force is moving toward a regular army that is capable of "attacks and defense". The "Self-Defense Force" that is so called "specializing in defense" will exist in name only. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> That the Japanese move has attracted much attention is firstly because these military decisions have impacts on Japan's peaceful constitution. </seg>

<seg id=4> My paying respect is to pray for Japan's peace and prosperity." </seg>
<seg id=5> Just ask, do Koizumi's so-called "war victims" include World War II Class A war criminals including Hideki Tojo? </seg>
<seg id=6> Does he mean that Japan's post-war peace and prosperity should be attributed to the contributions of those Class A war criminals? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Some reporters asked why he chose January 1 to pay his respect to the Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id=8> Koizumi said that it was a Japanese tradition to worship in temples on the first day of the New Year and many people go to temples to worship. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is understandable that ordinary people mourn relatives and friends, and many victims' family members have clearly stated that they worshiped in the Shrine only to mourn their relatives and friends and firmly opposed enshrining Class A war criminals in the Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Chinese people are reasonable. We firmly hold that the Japanese people should be separated from a small number of militarists and the ordinary people should be separated from the rightists.

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 31 from Los Angeles (by staff reporter Yan Liang) - The US Disease Control and Prevention Center said on 31st that the most serious flu epidemic in 30 years in the United States had reached its peak, with 45 of US' 50 states reporting the wide spread of the flu and the deaths caused by the flu increasing rapidly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> According to the center's statistics as of December 20, the death toll caused by the flu had hit a record by accounting for 7.8% of all deaths during the same period. </seg>
<seg id=4> At least 42 children have died from the flu across the US. Adult deaths are also rising rapidly but so far no exact statistics are available. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Experts have attributed the serious spread of the flu in 2003 to two reasons: firstly, the flu was not of "Panama A" type, which couldn't be prevented by the vaccine produced previously; secondly, since there was a surplus of vaccine last year, the two major vaccine suppliers had reduced their production to 83 million units, causing a shortage of vaccine supply this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although an average of 36,000 people die from flu and 114,000 others are hospitalized every year in the United States, the social panic caused by the spread of the flu this time was rarely seen before. </seg>
<seg id=7> US epidemic disease expert, William Thompson, said that the flu was the most serious in 30 years in the United States and it came earlier than before, which had widely spread in many schools. Long queues were seen where vaccine injections are offered. </seg>

<seg id=2> US President Regan had presented a long list of crimes committed by Libyan leader Gaddafi, accusing Libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and conducting military interferences abroad as well as terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=3> The two sides moved from the war of words to military actions. The US launched "Prairie Fire" and "El Dorado Canyon", two surgical air attacks against Libya. </seg>
<seg id=4> Later, the US imposed economic sanctions on Libya, attacking, containing and threatening the country in politics, diplomacy and military. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, Gaddafi never gave up under heavy pressures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Currently, the US-Libyan relations have warmed up. People have attributed this to the deterrent effect of the Iraqi war, which seems not right. </seg>
<seg id=7> In fact, over the past years, Gaddafi, who has a unique character, has been resisting the US on one hand while showing the olive branch to the US on the other, but has failed to receive any response. </seg>
<seg id=8> After the war in Iraq, the strategic adjustments made by various parties in the Middle East and restructuring of regional powers offered an opportunity for the resumption of US-Libyan diplomatic relations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> To Gaddafi, resuming friendly ties with the US will end sanctions, develop the economy, improve people's well-being, get rid of the isolation and get integrated into the international community. </seg>

<seg id=2> The so-called "Munich Security Policy Conference" was initiated by no-governmental individuals in Germany and is an international security forum sponsored by the German government.

<seg id=3> One of the top agendas of the meeting is to discuss the cross-Atlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id=4> Remarks made by European and US political figures during and after the meeting have shown that the two sides are trying hard to clear the shadow the Iraqi war has brought to their bilateral ties and are trying to go back on the track of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=5> Bertrams, Director of Berlin International and Security Affairs Research Institution, said this was a meeting to restore the European-US ties. Both sides had the willingness of going closer once again. </seg>
<seg id=6> To the European-US relations, the new information from the meeting is that Europe and the US need to resume talks. They need to seriously consider the common missions facing the two sides and find out the convergence of interests to fulfill these common missions. </seg>

Then why does it still make such a huge investment in setting up a special satellite TV station to cover 22 counties in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id=2> Staff members in charge of the "Freedom-1" TV station have been quoted as saying that it is to provide Arab nations a news platform with "comprehensive and just viewpoints". </seg>

<seg id=5> The US believes that the Islamic civilization is a severe hindrance for the West to push forward modern civilization. The extremist religious forces in Islamic nations in the Middle East are a hotbed for international terrorism characterized as anti-US. To effectively crack down on terrorism, the Islamic world must be reformed to conform with and accept western values, life styles and political systems. </seg>
<seg id=6> The US is attempting to use programs in the "Freedom-1" to exert a subtle influence to instill its own ideology to the Arab people. </seg>

<seg id=2> The two countries' officials have agreed on a timetable and forms of future talks and have established a mechanism for continuing talks, which symbolizes the resumption of Pakistani-Indian dialogue process that came to a standstill two years ago, and will lay a foundation for the two countries to gradually settle all standing issues including the conflict in Kashmir.

<seg id=8> Thirdly, after the bilateral ties saw ups and downs, the two countries have agreed that war is not a good way to solve disputes and the two sides should stay away from wars.

<seg id=1> After the "9/11" incident, US President Bush dished out a strategy of "preemptive strike" in June 2002 and brought it into practice in US foreign policy. The US launched the first war of "preemptive strike" in Iraq last March. </seg>
<seg id=2> The idea of "preemptive strike" is not only against the principles of international laws with "mutual respect to sovereignty and territorial integrity" as the core, but will inevitably result in the dangerous effect of imitation by others. New ups and downs will thus appear in the world order. </seg>
<seg id=3> When the theory of "preemptive strike" was first raised, some US politicians asked the question: "What will we do if other countries follow the US?" </seg>
<seg id=4> As expected, over the past two years, more and more countries are claiming to launch "preemptive strike". The squad advocating "preemptive strike" is getting bigger and bigger. </seg>
<seg id=5> This is a new trend that is worth paying attention to and study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Within the month when Bush proposed the strategy of "preemptive strike", Australian Prime Minister Howard was the first to stand out to show his support. </seg>
<seg id=7> He said that once it got hard evidence that terrorists would launch attacks against Australia, the country would take the "preemptive strike" strategy to launch military operations in neighboring countries. </seg>
<seg id=8> He even proposed to add the principle of "preemptive strike" into the UN Charter, believing that it was necessary to amend the UN Charter to empower various states the right of taking "preemptive strike" to crack down on terrorists or nations supporting terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=9> In northeastern Asia, the "Defense White Paper" issued by Japan's Defense Agency in July 1999 proposed that Japan launch "preemptive strike" on foreign bases if facing missile attacks or military invasion. </seg>

<seg id=1> Recently, there have been a lot of international comments on US' policy towards Africa. </seg>
<seg id=2> The US "Foreign Policy Focus" published in this January has carried an article titled "The 2004 African Policy Outlook". The article says that over the past year, the Bush administration's foreign policy has brought direct or indirect negative influences on Africa, especially the US dedication to the anti-terrorism war and the issue of proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction. The US cannot get away from Iraq, which has distracted its attention to Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> People still remember that to show his concern about Africa, the Bush administration has adopted a "President Helps AIDS Emergency Project" last January, promising to provide Africa at least $3 billion every year. </seg>
<seg id=4> Last July, President Bush visited five African countries including Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria and promised to offer African countries $15 billion for the prevention and cure of AIDS and another $100 million for anti-terrorism in Africa. He also announced assistance programs in Africa including the food emergency assistance program and education assistance program. </seg>
<seg id=5> These assistance programs were once well received in African countries and had won many praises from the international community. </seg>
<seg id=6> However, one year has past and the US has not yet to take concrete actions. </seg>

It has established the "African Union", which is responsible for coordinating African affairs, to implement "the Century Development Targets" set by the UN in 2000 and to make great efforts to reduce hunger and poverty and promote health and education. It has adopted "the New Partnership for African Development" to promote African countries' development. However, due to its poor economic basis, it has been short of development funds. </seg>
<seg id=9> The UN has called on the developed countries to divert 0.7% of their total GDP to assist the least developed countries. </seg>

<seg id=4> Looking back to Europe's history over the past 100 years, the German, French and British triangle ties are basically characterized by the British and French alliance containing or resisting Germany. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of January 5 from Ulan Bator (by staff reporter Lu Guodong) - Local media reported that by the end of 2003, the number of livestocks in Mongolia reached 25.3078 million, 1.6233 million more than that in the same period of last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> This was the first time that the number of livestocks rose following a sharp decline for 3 years in a row in Mongolia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The plenty rainfall last summer and little snowfall in spring and winter created favorable conditions for the improvement of Mongolia's animal husbandry. </seg>
<seg id=5> By the end of 2003, the country had a total of 255,600 camels, 1.9583 million horses, 1.7843 million cattle, 10.7062 million sheep and 10.6034 million goats. </seg>
<seg id=6> Compared with the same period of last year, the number of camels, goats and sheep went up while that of horses and cattle slightly decreased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Mongolia's animal husbandry was almost privatized in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, following privatization, the animal husbandry lived virtually "on the mercy of the nature". </seg>
<seg id=9> From 1994 to 1999, Mongolia enjoyed a booming animal husbandry for 6 years due to favorable weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id=10> At the end of 1999, the number of Mongolia's livestocks reached a record high of 33.5 million. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, from 2000 to 2002, big snowfalls in winter and dry weathers in summer for 3 consecutive years set back Mongolia's animal husbandry year after year. </seg>
<seg id=12> By the end of 2002, Mongolia's livestock number totaled only 23.6845 million, a decrease of 9.8155 million in 3 years. </seg>

<seg id=4> North Korea has offered a package of plans to solve the issue on the basis of taking simultaneous actions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The commentary reiterated that the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue through talks was North Korea's consistent stand. </seg>
<seg id=6> The US government should show goodwills to North Korea's stand. </seg>
<seg id=7> However, the United States is moving advanced weapons, which have been tested in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to South Korea and is speeding up its preparations to provoke a new war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The commentary also said that "North Korea will, in a toughest way, deal with the US complete denial of and threats to North Korea's ideology and systems". It was a due choice of self-defense to safeguard North Korea's sovereignty and the rights of living and protect peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the region. </seg>
<seg id=9> The more threats the United States is posing, the further steps North Korea will take to strengthen the anti-imperialism military frontline to deal with the US's use of force with military power. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of January 6 from New York (by staff reporter Xue Yanping) - A report issued on 6th by a US prominent research institution, the Association of Supply Administration, showed that the US service industry index declined in December last year, which demonstrated that the service industry's current growth still lagged behind that of the manufacturing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The report said that in December last year the service industry index, including retail, finance, construction and other non-manufacturing sectors, fell to 58.6 from 60.1 a month ago while the index was originally predicted to rise to 60.5 by some economists. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the standards set by the Association of Supply Administration, a service industry index of above 50 represents that the industry is expanding, while an index of under 50 represents that the industry is shrinking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to another report issued by the Association of Supply Administration on 2nd this month, the US manufacturing industry index rose sharply in December to the highest point in 20 years. </seg>
<seg id=6> This shows that the growth of US service industry is still lagging behind that of the manufacturing industry. </seg>
<seg id=7> The growth of manufacturing industry is helpful to creating more jobs and accelerating economic growth, but the growth of service industry will play an even bigger role in reducing unemployment and accelerating economic growth. </seg>

<seg id=4> The Shenzhen Bureau of Examination and Quarantine has overcome various kinds of difficulties to perform temperature tests and check health condition declaration forms. Apart from designating more staff members to the ports, it has immediately employed over 250 people, who have been assigned to posts at these ports after receiving group training, in an effort to ensure safe and smooth operation of the ports. Meanwhile, the bureau has also bought 60 more portable infrared temperature-testing machines to meet the needs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Shenzhen Bureau of Examination and Quarantine reminds relevant units and drivers that the "Entry/Exit Health Condition Declaration Forms" are available at service desks set up by the examination and quarantine authorities in all ports for distribution of the "Entry/Exit Vehicles and Goods (Individuals) Quarantine Supervision Form" or at quarantine check points where temperature tests are conducted and health condition declaration forms are checked. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of January 8 from New York - US dollar on 8th saw a big slump once again shortly after a brief rise on 7th influenced by remarks made by President of the European Central Bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in a comment that a strong Euro had a negative impact on European firms' exports, but he said that the world economic recovery and a stronger consumption demand had partly offset the impact brought about by a rising Euro. </seg>
<seg id=4> He also pointed out that a strong Euro could to some extent play a role of stabilizing the prices in the Euro region, so the European Central Bank had decided to maintain the original rate of interest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> As investors saw the remarks as a sign that officials in the Euro region are not worried about a rising Euro, they sold out US dollars, leading to a decline of the dollar against major western currencies, with the British Pound hitting a new high against the US dollar in 11 years. </seg>

A total of 31 tombs dated back to Western Zhou Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period were discovered in an area of nearly 20,000 square meters, which would soon be taken over for use. </seg>
<seg id=4> The archaeological team from Yongcheng, Shaanxi Province, excavated a total of 40 pieces of antiques including bronze and pottery wares from these tombs. </seg>
<seg id=5> Among them was a Qin tomb, which had a big coffin with two coffins inside. There was a sacrificial tomb for two horses near the tomb. </seg>
<seg id=6> Fifteen bronze and pottery wares were excavated from the tomb. The bronze wares included pots, basins and axes. </seg>
<seg id=7> The bronze pots, delicately made and beautifully designed, bear a style of bronze ware making techniques of Western Zhou Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=8> Judging from the sacrificial objects in the tomb, the owner of the tomb could be a Qin noble in the late Western Zhou Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=9> Experts have thus predicted that there should be a large group of tombs nearby. </seg>
<seg id=10> The unexpected discovery has offered valuable archeological references in the research of the move of Qin Dynasty capital and the layout of Yongcheng during Qin and Han Dynasties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Tian Yaqi, deputy researcher of the Archaeological Research Institute of Shaanxi Province and head of the excavation team, said that in the past the archaeological circle had always believed that the palace zone in Sunjianantou Village became the place for holding important royal sacrificial activities from Qin to Western Han dynasties only after the Qin people moved their capital to Yongcheng. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the findings this time showed that this place was a city of Western Zhou Dynasty and had experienced prosperity several times long before the capital was moved to Yongcheng. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Economists Predict US to Be the Biggest Winner of Dollar Devaluation </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of January 23 from Davos, Switzerland (by staff reporters Li Jie and Ding Xigang) - Discussions on the devaluation trend of US dollars were held on 23rd at the ongoing 34th World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Some experts predicted that the United States would be the biggest winner of the continuous decline of the dollar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Most of the economists attending the meeting held that US officials, including US Treasure Secretary John Snow, seemed to have given up the "strong US dollar policy", which had been in place in recent years. </seg>
<seg id=4> The decline of the US dollar would provide the United States larger economic development space and more job opportunities, which was extremely obvious in the manufacturing sector. </seg>
<seg id=5> Meanwhile, the decline of the US dollar had made American products more competitive in both domestic and international markets, which could help the US make up for its trade deficits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> However, experts said that a weak US dollar would also have negative impact on the United States. </seg>
<seg id=7> Firstly, the US stock markets would probably remain sluggish with all investment value declining and foreign investors withdrawing investment for fear of a further decline of US dollars; secondly, the soaring prices of imported products would eventually lead to deterioration of American people's living standards; thirdly, a marginal decline of US dollars might cause unrest in trade and finance sectors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> However, the devaluation of US dollars would do even greater harm to Europe, Japan and Canada. </seg>
<seg id=9> Following the decline of the US dollar, pressures had mounted on Europe's exports, which had confronted the European economy with a danger of all-round decline. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The lawsuit seeking for sanctions was raised following the US failure to abolish the Byrd Amendment before a deadline set by the WTO. </seg>

<seg id=3> Under the act, children born of foreigners in Denmark will no longer have the right of automatically being granted citizenship. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> The act is the latest of a series of measures to restrict immigration since the Danish Liberal Party leader Rasmussen became Prime Minister in November 2001. </seg>
<seg id=5> Reports say the act is most likely to be endorsed by the parliament as the Liberal Party has won the support from the right-wing Danish People's Party on the immigration issue. </seg>

<seg id=2> It is the EU's foreign policy direction to struggle for independence in diplomacy and to seek attitudes and ways to deal with world affairs different from the US, from which the influence of France can be seen. </seg>
<seg id=3> It is because of this that the international community, including China, Russia and Arab countries, all expect to see the EU to rise as a completely independent force in international relations. </seg>

<seg id=4> We must admit that since late 1980s, the EU has been moving towards this direction in diplomacy. </seg>

<seg id=1> On February 24, President Bush announced that he would support a constitution amendment of banning homosexual marriage. </seg>
<seg id=2> This is an obvious turn from his ambiguous attitude toward the issue in several months and represents an important political development in the US election year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The constitution amendment banning homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern US, which is a newly emerging base of the Republican Party. But It also has very negative effect because it is a cultural dispute that can split the public opinion all around the US, which is likely to aggravate US political polarization and further alienate the eastern and western costal areas dominated by the liberals. </seg>
<seg id=4> It is obvious that Bush's deeds have gone against his words as he claimed to be a "unifier" instead of a "splitter" during the 2000 election campaign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> In addition, the American younger generation has become more and more open on the issue of homosexual marriage. Bush's move will have short-term effect but will do harm to the Republican Party's long-term interests. </seg>
<seg id=6> Bush's new constitution amendment campaign can be seen as a "scorched earth policy" in this year's presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Bush has adopted this policy because he has been increasingly troubled by the two topics of "anti-terrorism" and economy-employment and has to open new battlefields on topics of religions and cultures to split the public opinion. </seg>

<seg id=1> The United States has so far taken a cautious attitude. </seg>
<seg id=2> In other words, since maintaining Taiwan Straits' status quo is in the interests of the US long-term objective of containing the mainland, the US is trying to avoid political and military clashes with China as a result of encouraging Taiwan independence. </seg>
<seg id=3> It is predictable that the US is unable to completely eliminate the room for Taiwan to hold a referendum as requested by Beijing, but considering its own interests it will take some moves of early warning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Recently, US Secretary of State Powell has taken the initiative to reiterate the Taiwan policy set before to show US opposition to Taiwan independence. </seg>
<seg id=5> These remarks are seen to prevent Chen Shui-bian from taking extremist actions. </seg>
<seg id=6> The recent remarks made by some US intelligence individuals with government backgrounds and a large number of espionage ships sent by the US to the Taiwan Straits to conduct reconnaissance on the cross-strait military movement all have indirectly demonstrated that the US is closely watching the situation across the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id=7> It has shown from another perspective that although the US will not prevent Taiwan from holding the referendum as requested by Beijing, it is likewise concerned about the uncertainties existing in the situation of the Taiwan Strait. </seg>

<seg id=2> Generally speaking, academic pressure is a cause of young people's suicide. However, research found that emotional problems, especially the love affairs between man and woman and the relationship with their parents, are the main causes of young people's suicide. </seg>

<seg id=3> Academic pressure and failing to meet expectations are certainly topics that parents and children should communicate with each other. </seg>
<seg id=4> Academic pressure is an inevitable burden for local students. The pressure sometimes comes from themselves but in many occasions, it is imposed on the children by their parents. </seg>
<seg id=5> Parents have high expectation for their children's good academic performance and often compare them with other children, requiring them to try to become the top students, which will certainly bring much pressure. However, the communication channels behind the pressure are the real thermometer to measure the intimate relationship between parents and their children. </seg>
<seg id=6> If a child's performance is below expectation, their parents' beating and scolding or straightening their faces as a silent blame, or even making the child feel he/she is disappointing will undoubtedly push the child into a helpless and desperate position. </seg>

<seg id=1> An AIDS Suffering Child Is Barred From School And The Angry Priest Principal Lodged A Lawsuit Against Officials </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP in Nairobi on 7th) D'Agostino, an outspoken American priest who is in charge of an orphanage of AIDS suffering kids in Nairobi (capital of Kenya), lodged a lawsuit against the Kenya government to get justice for an AIDS suffering child, demanding it to force the public school to renounce its exclusion of HIV children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Although the number of HIV victims is estimated to be 2.5 million in the country, AIDS and HIV are still taboo subjects in Kenya. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> D'Agostino is in charge of the Nyumbani Orphanage which houses many HIV children. He claims that many of his children are barred from primary schools. The practice of these schools is against the government policy of compulsory primary school education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Lawyer Nanwamba of D'Agostino said at the court presided over by Judge Koome: "Barring children, especially HIV sufferers, from public schools is inhumane and illegal and violates human rights. Receiving education is a basic human right and turning down these children is an infringement upon their rights." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> D'Agostino is seeking a court order to force the school accept children without inquiring whether or not they are infected with HIV. </seg>

<seg id=3> The Democratic Progressive Party wishes to work hand in hand with democratic parties of other countries by this means and share its development experience in democratic progress with other countries, make contribution to peace, stability and prosperity of Asia and realize the ideal of "Asian Democratic League" as early as possible. </seg>

<seg id=4> Today when the international situation changes instantly fast, the fluctuation of regional powers causes changes in the entire world and the security of every nation is on trial. </seg>
<seg id=5> As far as the Asian and Pacific region is concerned, North Korea who is arrogant to have nuclear facilities has trial-launched missiles many times since US started its war against Iraq last month. The missiles flew over Japanese territorial sky. Besides, China has accelerated its arms expansion and aimed its missiles at Taiwan since long time ago. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> Such issues as related to consolidating democracy and maintaining security can only be discussed and solved through a formal security mechanism. </seg>

<seg id=1> Today it is an important moment which encourages us to continue our march on the road of reform. We give our highest regard to all the comrades in the party who embody our Party spirit and endeavor to achieve the goal of reform together. </seg>
<seg id=2> "Political parties withdrawing from the radio and TV media" is the most fundamental requirement of medium reform and also the idea which the Democratic Progressive Party has always adhered to. The Democratic Progressive Party in power will accelerate the pace of reform instead of being a hindrance or a burden. </seg>
<seg id=3> We are also aware that to achieve this goal the Party members of public service should take the lead to leave media. Although this is a small step in the reform, it is also a key step. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the past age of martial law and medium monopoly, many of the Party comrades, in order to strive for an open space for public opinion, have shouldered the difficult mission to set up the 4th TV station and local broadcasting stations. They wished to break through the existent limitation and add vigor to promote the reform of medium environment by this means. </seg>
<seg id=5> For example, Comrade Trong Chai took painstaking efforts for the birth of the 4th TV station and "Formosa Television" was born at last. </seg>
<seg id=6> This success had considerable impact on the whole medium environment. It broke up the monopoly by 3 stations and created larger space for the progress of CATV. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> But we must know that there are many deeds we have to do in the process of reform due to limits of historical environment. Therefore, today's complete open and free medium space represents the achievement of some periodic tasks. To continue the reform process, we have to give up things and make sacrifice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The standing members of the Party Central Committee demand that all the party members of public service withdraw from TV medium business before the next session of the legislative opens. i.e. before September 5 so as to set an example and honor their promise to the people. </seg>
<seg id=9> We greatly appreciate all your efforts to adhere to Party's ideals and goals, including Trong Chai, Chang Chun-hsiung, Chou Ching-yu, Hou Shui-sheng, Kao Meng-ting, Hwang Nai-hui and Shen Ming-gong who gave up their personal interests to promote the medium reform. </seg>

<seg id=1> To be a ruling party does not mean the holding of power but the increase of responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id=2> The Democratic Progressive Party has suffered setbacks and bumps in the process of holding power, but we can always turn challenges into motives for advance and lead Taiwan in constructing the project of deepening its democracy. At the same time we try to meet international standards in global democracy, peace and prosperity. </seg>
<seg id=3> For we are always convinced that only the people are the masters of the country and the responsibility of the Democratic Progressive Party is to upgrade the Party's founding spirit of "clean, diligence and love for the homeland " to the prospects of "reform, progress and a good life" so as to lay a foundation for the long-term peace for the 23 million people in Taiwan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> For a long time the Democratic Progressive Party has played the role of "part of the government" in the effort to expand the diplomacy of Taiwan and has made outstanding achievements in this regard. </seg>
<seg id=5> We have never yielded to the continual pressure from the Communist Party of China because we have destiny in our own hands. Even if there are no rich resources, the Democratic Progressive Party has made headways step by step and has created room for Taiwan to participate in international affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "Multi-diplomacy" has been the chief axis of the overall diplomatic strategy of the Democratic Progressive Party. In the past year we have, based on the platform of "Asian Federation of Liberal Democracy", carried out successful experience sharing and party exchange with the countries in the region on such issues as East Asia's economic challenges, democratic reform of political parties, sweeping away money politics, global poverty, political publicity and communication, youth participation in politics. </seg>
<seg id=7> I will take over the chairman of "CALD" in March of next year and wish to create more opportunities for Taiwan to contribute more to the international community in the capacity of a world organization leader. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Besides, the Democratic Progressive Party took an active part in the affairs of "Liberal International" after it became its member last year. </seg>

<seg id=3> It is because we have been on the side of democracy and reform that we have won the trust of the Taiwan people. It is because of this that the responsibilities and missions we bear for the future become even more grave and great. </seg>

<seg id=5> In 1991 overall re-election of the parliament was held; in 1994 the president was directly elected; in 1997 the provincial government organizations were frozen; in 2000 the National Assembly became non permanent. The series of constitution revisions are the legality trail of Taiwan people in intensifying sovereignty and democracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> If we regard the direct election of the president in 1996 as the most significant sign to show that Taiwan has become a democracy with independent sovereignty, this country "in its integrity" is already over 10 years old. </seg>
<seg id=7> After 10 years of practice we should ponder what to pursue next as a democracy with independent sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id=8> We must say that at the next stage we should further pursue more profound democracy and more efficient constitutional government system. Only by doing this can we lead the Taiwan people in confronting severe challenges of the new century. </seg>

<seg id=2> For this purpose we have made every endeavor, have shown the greatest sincerity and have lots of work. </seg>
<seg id=3> However, our efforts met with provocation from Taiwan authorities and forces that advocate "Taiwan Independence". </seg>

<seg id=1> Leaders of Taiwan Authorities claim: "To prevent armed invasion of Taiwan by China and one-sided change of the status quo across the Strait, we advocate 3.20 public referendum." </seg>
<seg id=2> This is a slander of the peace efforts by the mainland and a provocation to the relations across the Strait. </seg>
<seg id=3> At present the actual threat to Taiwan security does not come from mainland but from the "Taiwan independence" spitting activities launched on a large scale by the Taiwan authorities. </seg>
<seg id=4> It is the splittism forces of "Taiwan independence" that sabotage the status quo of the relations across the Strait and are the immediate sources of menace against peace in Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id=5> The Taiwan authorities distorted the position of the mainland to oppose "Taiwan independence" splittism and maintain Taiwan stability as a suppression of democracy and liberty of Taiwan. With this pretext, it plans to launch a public referendum. </seg>
<seg id=6> This is sheer fabrication and confounding black with white. Its real aim is to win sympathy and support for its splittism line. </seg>
<seg id=7> The leader of Taiwan authorities advocates the so-called "defensive public referendum" and "peaceful public referendum", which, in whatever package they may be, will only give rise to opposition and hostility across the Strait, further aggravate the tension and push the relations across the Strait gradually onto the edge of danger. </seg>
<seg id=8> This runs counter to the mainstream public opinion of Taiwan compatriots for peace, stability and development. It is misleading to and a control of Taiwan public instead of a deepening of Taiwan democracy. It is also a menace to the peace and stability of the Asian-Pacific region. It will undoubtedly meet with the general opposition of the compatriots across the strait and the international community. </seg>

<seg id=3> At present with  the development of scince and technology and economic globalization by leaps and bounds, creation, possession and utilization of knowledge and intellectual resources, quantities and quality of the possessed intellectual property have become important basis for a country to participate in international competition. </seg>

<seg id=6> One of the fundamental reasons why advanced practical technology has been successfully applied on large areas, why rural enterprises have developed vigorously and why surplus labor force from rural areas has migrated in large number to coastal regions and cities and towns lies in the fact that hundreds of millions of rural laborers who have completed their compulsory education serve as the foundation and support. The popularization of compulsory education in the countryside has scored great achievements which can not be ignored. </seg>
<seg id=7> Presently, the agriculture and rural economy of our country are at a key developing moment.

<seg id=1> A few days ago, the Provisional Governing Council of Iraq and the US occupying authorities concluded an agreement in Baghdad, announcing a schedule of returning power to Iraq by June next year step by step. </seg>
<seg id=2> This agreement is recognized and accepted by the international community with some reservation. Although the foreign minister of EU expressed his welcome, France thinks "the process is too slow". While the UN Secretary General Annan "feels encouraged" by the plan of turning over the power, Meanwhile, he indicates that "time is not mature" for UN to play its role in Iraq. Russia simply doubts the legality of the agreement. </seg>
<seg id=3> The Iraqi public are apathetic in response. The US public opinion even believes "it is a great gamble." </seg>
<seg id=4> In short people half believe and half doubt it. They adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It is not without reason that the international community is dubious about it. </seg>
<seg id=6> Because people see that handing over the power is something US has to do, the power transfer can never be complete, which will inevitably leave behind many foreshadowing. </seg>
<seg id=7> First, the interim transitional government to be established by May next year will not be directly elected by the Iraqi people, but by "the transitional national congress" which will be elected by 18 provincial election committees. </seg>

<seg id=2> At a time when China is making persistent efforts to promote the Sino-American trade cooperation, this trade protectionism measure by US is unavoidably disappointing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Today when economic globalization is progressing fast, the reimposing of limit on Chinese textiles by the US government is out of accord with the times. </seg>
<seg id=4> First, this abuse of "quota" measure hinders the implementation of the WTO principle of free trade. </seg>
<seg id=5> Talking in a high-sounding way about "free trade" on the one hand, US resorts to underhand means by imposing "quotas" and builds the trade barrier again. Does it not seem too arbitrary and unfair? </seg>
<seg id=6> Secondly, the "quota" hinders the positive development of the Sino-American economic and trade relations. </seg>

<seg id=1> Bush failed to achieve his purpose in visiting Britain. There are many reasons for this. The most important reason is that US became the sole super-power after the cold war was over. It regards all the other countries as insignificant and its unilateralism keeps expanding. </seg>
<seg id=2> US, without being authorized by UN, launched the war against Iraq. It does not respect the opinions of its main allies on important international issues like the reconstruction of Iraq. It enrages most of the countries by doing things at its own will. </seg>
<seg id=3> A public opinion poll released by the Commission of the European Communities shows that 68% of the EU citizens do not think US had ample reason to launch the Iraq war and 53% believe that US has posed a threat to world peace. </seg>
<seg id=4> Secondly, US stresses the importance of fighting against terrorism and demands its allies to contribute troops and money. But it ignores the issues of their concern. </seg>
<seg id=5> The US takes a tight control of the reconstruction projects of Iraq. It granted the major projects of the first bidding to the companies of its own country and refused to share. As for the dispute over steel trade, the WTO has made its arbitrary decision that the US high tariff has violated the rules. The British business circles wished Bush to yield, but he did not give an explicit answer in the end. </seg>
<seg id=6> Thirdly, US imposes the values of its own country on others as the highest principles and insists on democratic transformation of the Middle East countries. This has met with opposition and some of its allies demand US to respect the culture and characteristics of the Islamic countries. They think that the reason why US troops are caught in the quagmire of Iraq lies in its "failure to respect" it. </seg>

<seg id=1> After a dispute as long as half a year, the advance unit of Japan Self Defense Forces finally left for Iraq at the end of 2003. </seg>
<seg id=2> This is the first time after the Second World War for Japan to send its troops overseas. </seg>
<seg id=3> It reflects the will of Japan to become a political and military power. It also indicates a change of the defense strategy of Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The reason why this movement of Japan Self Defense Forces is conspicuous is that it is not an isolated event. </seg>
<seg id=5> Taking advantage of the Afghani war, Japan made a breakthrough in sending its Self Defense Forces to other countries. Also by taking advantage of the Korean Peninsula issue, Japan passed "Emergency Legislation" which leaves foreshadowing for the Self Defense Forces to take pre-emptive actions. Recently Koizumi's Cabinet has passed "the Essential Plan of Assisting Iraq Reconstruction Projects," which leaves foreshadowing for sending the soldiers to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=6> Step by step Japan has broken through the limit set by Japan's peace constitution and has sent its troops to the overseas battlefields. </seg>
<seg id=7> Besides, Japan is planning to revise the "Nation's Basic Defense Framework" in 2004 so as to make its sending troops overseas legalized and permanent. It also plans to establish a non-provisional "permanent troops" for the purpose of operation in other countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> At the same time the Japanese cabinet, on the pretext of the so-called "North Korean missile threat", has made the decision to start mapping out its missile defensive system in early 2004. It has also introduced from US the "standard missile-3" and the "patriot missile-3" in order to intercept those missiles outside or returning to atmosphere. So a double missile intercepting network has been formed. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is not difficult to figure out that Japan Self Defense Forces is developing towards a regular army which "combines offence with defense". The "Self Defense Forces" which "is solely engaged in defense" will cease to exist except in name. </seg>

<seg id=4> My visit is to appeal for Japan's peace and prosperity." </seg>
<seg id=5> Let's ask Koizumi whether or not the so-called "war victims" included such first-class war criminals as Hideki Tojo? </seg>
<seg id=6> Could it be said that the post-war peace and prosperity in Japan was also including the contribution on the basis of first-class war criminals? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Some journalist asked him why he chose January 1 to visit the Shrine? </seg>
<seg id=8> Koizumi answered that it is a tradition in Japan to visit the Shrine on January 1. Many people visit the Shrine on this day. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is understandable that common people mourn over the death of their relatives and friends.

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency in Los Angeles on Dec. 31st (Reporter Yan Liang) The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on 31st that the great influenza whose scale has not been seen for 30 years has reached its highest point. Large spread of the disease is found in 45 of the US 50 states and death cases caused by influenza grow drastically. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> According to the statistics of the Center by December 20th, the deaths caused by influenza already account for 7.8% of all deaths, a record high. </seg>
<seg id=4> At least 42 children have died of influenza in all over the states. Deaths of adults grow quickly, but no accurate statistics is available. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to experts, there are 2 reasons for the quick spread of influenza in 2003. First, the influenza virus is not the "Panama A Virus" of the past few years and the vaccines produced earlier cannot effectively prevent it. Second, two major vaccine manufacturers have reduced their production down to 83 million shots this year because of surplus last year. This has resulted in the short supply of vaccines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although 36,000 people die of influenza and 114,000 people are hospitalized because of the disease each year on an average, such a influenza spread that has caused social panic is rare. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to William Thompson, an expert of epidemics, this influenza is the most serious in recent 30 years. It came earlier than the past and large-scale spread occurred in many schools. There are long queues in the place where vaccines are injected against influenza. </seg>
<seg id=8> Facing such a severe situation, the American Health Ministry launched its emergency treatment center on December 19 and dispatched its expert groups to the states. </seg>

<seg id=1> US which leads the world in medium field has a lot to say in international press. Its tentacles of public opinion propaganda radiate to all over the world and there is no place they cannot reach. Then why does it spend so much money on a special satellite TV station covering 22 countries in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id=2> Just as the responsible person of "First Freedom TV" station put it, it aims to provide a press platform with "all-round and fair views" for the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id=3> But some analyst point out that "First Freedom TV" will be America's strategic weapon to carry out cultural infiltration, cultural intrusion and psychological offence in Arab countries. It will be an important propaganda tool for US to reshape the Middle East and transform the Islamic world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Judging from this we see that "First Freedom TV" has unusual missions. Its chief missions are the following 3. First, its mission is to spread "freedom concept". </seg>
<seg id=5> US believes that the Islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the western efforts in promoting modern civilization. The extreme religious forces in the Middle East Islamic countries are hotbed of international terrorism characteristic of opposing the USA. To effectively fight against terror, the Islamic world must be transformed so that it identifies with and accepts the western values, the western life style and the political system. </seg>
<seg id=6> The US attempts to instill its ideology into Arabs through the imperceptible influence of "First Freedom TV" programs. </seg>
<seg id=7> Secondly, it aims to improve the image of the USA. </seg>
<seg id=8> US abides by unilateralism in its foreign policy. On many international issues it parades its strength and do things at its own will. Its hegemonic acts enrage the Arab countries and the Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id=9> After the "September 11" incident, the contradiction between US which has taken side with Israel and the Middle East Islamic world is being intensified. </seg>

<seg id=8> Thirdly, the two countries, after experiencing ups and downs in the relationship between the 2 countries, unanimously make it clear that war is not a good method to settle the conflict and both sides should keep away from war. This consensus has laid a good foundation for the future leaders of the 2 countries to reach an understanding of "no war forever between Pakistan and India." </seg>

<seg id=2> The "pre-emptive" idea not only goes against the principle of international law which takes "mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity" as the kernel but also will inevitably give rise to the dangerous imitation effects.

<seg id=1> Recently, subtle changes have taken place in the mainstream reports of Japan's media on the economic development in China. </seg>
<seg id=2> Contrary to the past "theory of China threat", many reports in Japan now hold that China's economic development is helpful to the recovery of Japan's economy and China's big growing market demand is an important impetus to Japan's economic development. </seg>
<seg id=3> The US "Newsweek" recently said in an article that the rise of China is an opportunity instead of a menace to other countries especially to its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id=4> The wide-spread "theory of China threat" is being replaced by "theory of China opportunity". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Theory of China threat" asserts that the development of China poses a threat to other countries, especially to its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id=6> However this provocative instigation of assumption has not been accepted by China's neighbors. </seg>
<seg id=7> The former Malaysian premier Mahathir once said straight away: "Asian countries need not be afraid of China's growing military and economic power, for China does not have the tradition of conquering other countries." </seg>
<seg id=8> The Indian Defense Ministry also believes in one of its long-term plans that China constitutes no threat to India. </seg>
<seg id=9> In trade governments and enterprises of different countries regard China as their best choice to expand their markets. Overseas investors of big picture firmly illustrate the "theory of China opportunity" with actions: over 400 of the world 500 top enterprises have invested in China. </seg>
<seg id=10> China has ranked among the top countries in the world in absorbing foreign investment for several years on end. </seg>

<seg id=1> GDP is an important macro economic index universally used in the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> It is extremely important for our country to maintain a GDP growth in the whole process of our modernization drive. </seg>
<seg id=3> Only because the GDP growth by each percent will bring about job opportunities for 800,000 people in our country, we do have every reason to maintain the fast economic growth rate. </seg>
<seg id=4> The grand goal of building an all-round well-off society and the strategic aim for the 3rd stage of our modernization depend on the sustained fast GDP growth to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, we should see the deficiencies of GDP. </seg>
<seg id=6> For instance, it cannot easily reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth accurately, nor the social welfare level actually enjoyed by people, Nor can it accurately measure social distribution and social justice, etc. </seg>
<seg id=7> On the other hand, GDP is not unique. </seg>
<seg id=8> In assessing the achievements of an official we should not merely set our eyes on GDP growth, but on the actual material and cultural livelihood of the masses, and also on the unemployment in the locality, social security, social justice, social order, social administration, social harmony, etc. </seg>
<seg id=9> Therefore, we should approach the GDP accounting system with a scientific spirit, a scientific attitude and scientific ideological methods and give a right place to GDP in the economic and social development. </seg>
<seg id=10> While we must maintain a considerable growth rate, we must not attach too much importance to it, let alone being one-sided or deliberately going after it. </seg>

<seg id=1> Since the delegation of the Security Council visited the 6 countries in west Africa at the end of last June, inspiring changes have taken place in the general situation of the whole region although one or two countries have experienced some relapses. </seg>
<seg id=2> We are glad to notice that the Sierra Leone government has made positive progress in promoting the capability of the army and the police, intensifying the control of the country's diamond, preparing for the election of local governments, etc. The UN Mission in Sierra Leone is gradually reducing in its size according to the plan. </seg>
<seg id=3> What also inspries us is that, with the disposition of UN Mission in Liberia, Liberia is getting rid of the influence of the long-time war and is embarking on the road to restoration and reconstruction. </seg>
<seg id=4> Guinea-Bissau has made headways in its political process and the transitional government has promised to hold legislature election in March this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire is taking a turn for the better after some setbacks. All the sides have promised to implement "Linas-Marcoussis Accord" and "the new army" announces to return to the national reconciliation government. The Security Council is considering to send peace-keepers to the country. </seg>
<seg id=6> We are looking forward to the decision of the Security Council in this regard as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=7> The secretariat, the west African Economic Community and other related sides are working hard to settle the problems of small arms, mercenary troops, children soldiers, etc. and they have made progress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> While acknowledging the above progress completely, we should see that the general situation in the region of west Africa still has its fragile sides. Especially, due to geographical and historical factors, the countries in this region are closely linked and the situation in one country influences another. The turmoil in one country may spread to its neighbors and even to the whole region. </seg>
<seg id=9> Therefore, as suggested by the Security Council report, when trying to solve the issues in West Africa, the international community including the Security Council should persist in a comprehensive and all-sided strategy, i.e. endeavoring to solve the cross-border issues; Meanwhile, it should actively help the relevant countries, the African Union, the West African Economic Community and other regional and sub-regional organizations to enhance their capability in preventing and settling conflicts. </seg>

<seg id=1> National reconciliation is the important condition for peace and stability in the regions after conflicts. </seg>
<seg id=2> After the conflict is over, the peaceful situation cannot really be consolidated and the conflict flames may even be rekindled if the sides concerned cannot forget their past grudges and give up their past resentments. </seg>
<seg id=3> Under many circumstances to achieve national reconciliation after a conflict needs joint endeavor from all sides and at the same time requires the international community, especially UN, to provide support and assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> For years UN has played a helpful role in promoting the process of national reconciliation in pro-conflict countries and has accumulated much experience. We think that generally speaking UN has to correctly handle 3 major relationships hereinafter in order to successfully help the post-conflict countries to achieve national reconciliation. </seg>

<seg id=5> It should integrate immediate needs with long-term goals. </seg>
<seg id=6> National reconciliation normally calls for a considerable process and it can hardly be accomplished in one move. </seg>
<seg id=7> There should be different priorities at different phases. </seg>
<seg id=8> The first thing to do in achieving national reconciliation is to make the former fighters to "say good-bye to arms" so as to create an environment of safety. </seg>

<seg id=4> After repeated negotiation the Anti-Terror Committee has submitted a formal report which is distributed as a document of the Security Council. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency in Los Angeles on January 19th (Reporter Yan Liang) An influential economic development research institution in the Silicon Valley region, USA issued a report recently that the unemployment rate in the Silicon Valley is falling rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=3> This is a noteworthy signal showing that the hi-tech industry in the region begins to recover. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The non-profit organization "Joint Venture Silicon Valley Network" said in its annual report "2004 Index of Silicon Valley" that the unemployment rate in the Silicon Valley region between the 2nd season of 2002 and 2nd season of 2003 dropped from the previous year's 10% to the present 5%. </seg>
<seg id=5> The report predicts that the unemployment rate will continue to fall with the recovery of hi-tech industry. </seg>
<seg id=6> Presently the economic development of the Silicon Valley confronts the following challenge: large number of well trained hi-tech workers are needed to fill up the new job vacancies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The report says that of all hi-tech trades in the Silicon Valley, the bio-technological industry has the lowest unemployment rate and its recovery trend is the most obvious. The risk investment amount attracted by the bio-technological industry in the Valley is for the first time at the same level with that of the computer software industry. </seg>
<seg id=8> The report holds that the bio-technological industry will play an increasingly important role in the economic development of the Silicon Valley. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The report also shows that the average pay of the employees in the Silicon Valley fell for the 3rd consecutive year from the 2nd season of 2002 to the 2nd season of 2003. But the decline rate went down from 6% in the previous year to 1.5% at present. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency in Davos of Switzerland on January 23rd (Reporters Li Jie and Ding Xigang) At the 34th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum being held in Davos in Switzerland, the issue of USD devaluation was discussed on 23rd. Some experts predict that America will be the biggest winner of the continuous low exchange rate of USD. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Most of the economic experts attending the meeting hold that American officials, including its Secretary of the Treasure John Snow, seemingly have already given up the "powerful USD policy" pursued by  US for years. </seg>
<seg id=4> The low exchange rate of USD will provide US with larger room for economic development and more job opportunities, which is extremely obvious in the manufacturing industry. </seg>
<seg id=5> At the same time the devaluation of USD makes US products more competitive on the domestic and world markets. This is conducive for US to compensate its adverse balance of trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Bur experts also believe the weak USD will bring about negative effect on America too. </seg>
<seg id=7> First of all the American stock market may continue to go down and the value of various investments falls. Foreign investors may withdraw their funds for fear of further USD devaluation. Secondly, imported goods are more and more expensive, resulting in the decline of American people's livelihood. Thirdly, large-scale devaluation of USD may give rise to turbulence in trade and finance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> But the devaluation of USD brings more serious blows to Europe, Japan and Canada. </seg>

<seg id=5> Such proliferation embodies itself in 2 aspects. </seg>
<seg id=6> First, some countries above the intermediate level in resources and strength have tried every means to produce and possess nuclear weapon to achieve their diplomatic ends of contending with their neighbors, maintaining peace and blackmail strategy. </seg>

<seg id=2> This is a noticeable change of his ambiguous attitude on this issue for months and it represents a major political development in America's year of election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The constitutional amendment on banning homosexual marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern America which is the new headquarters of the Republican. But it also has its negative effect, i.e. this cultural dispute of great magnitude which splits public opinion will undoubtedly speed up the polarization of American politics all over the country and will further alienate the east and the west coasts dominated by liberalists. </seg>

<seg id=2> In other words, because maintaining the status quo on Taiwan Strait can meet the American long-term goal of checking the mainland in strategy, US has to avoid political and military conflicts with China resulting from encouraging Taiwan independence. </seg>

All this indicated indirectly that US is very much concerned about the situation in Taiwan Strait. </seg>

<seg id=1> First of all, whether the Taiwan situation is within or beyond the estimation of Beijing. </seg>
<seg id=2> Nobody but Beijing itself knows how it estimates the situation. But the result of the estimation can be inferred from some public phenomena. </seg>
<seg id=3> For 4 years Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of the independent camp have been clear-cut in rhetoric, smart and diligent in action and progressive and aggressive in independent endeavor. </seg>
<seg id=4> On the contrary Beijing, except for occasional high-pitched rhetoric, is close to routine in its attitude and seems indifferent to the progress of Taiwan independence. </seg>
<seg id=5> But since the fall last year, it has become entirely different, as if an ox-cart changes into a car. Since several months ago, It has been obvious that its handling capacity is completely different from that in 1990s. </seg>

<seg id=1> With the advent of a new century, economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge to African countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> The leaders of African countries have realized more and more clearly that Africa cannot afford to allow another opportunity to slip by and must actively seek ways to deal with the situation. </seg>
<seg id=3> On July 9, 2002, the African Union was officially established and started operation.  Since then, the African countries, while actively implementing the "New Partnership for Africa's Development," working hard to develop the economy and trying to get themselves out of the unfavorable situation in the economic globalization, have also been making every effort to resolve armed conflicts, the major obstacle in the rejuvenation of Africa, so as to create a united, peaceful and stable environment. </seg>
<seg id=4> At present, the overall situation in Africa tends to be easing off.  The hot issues are obviously cooling off and all countries feel it more urgent to end the armed conflicts. </seg>
<seg id=5> With the strong support from the United Nations and the international community, influential regional organizations, regional big powers and prominent politicians in Africa are all taking active actions, stepping up their efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate civil strife.  Some conflicts and turmoil that lasted for years are now basically under control. </seg>
<seg id=6> For example, a government of national unity was established in Congo-Kinshasa in June last year; Sao Tome and Principe peacefully resolved a coup crisis in July; the Liberian government and the rebel armed groups signed a peace accord in August in Accra, capital of Ghana; the Sudanese government and the southern rebel armed groups started the crucial talks in September that broke the stalemate in peace process; various Somali armed forces and political factions started a peace talk in Kenya in October to discuss the peace process in the entire country; and the Burundi government and rebel armed groups signed a peace agreement in November and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Of course, the current stability in Africa is still relatively tenuous and the peace achievements still need to be consolidated.  And some potential or existing armed conflicts are still to be finally resolved. </seg>
<seg id=8> In the meantime, the economic growth rate in African countries is still far behind those in the developing countries in Asia and other regions.  These are all unfavorable factors in the development of Africa. </seg>
<seg id=9> How African countries can effectively cope with the challenge of economic globalization and realize the dream of African rejuvenation still needs the long-term and arduous efforts on the part of the African peoples. </seg>

<seg id=1> AIDS-infected Children Rejected for School Admission; Angry Priest Director Takes Government to Court </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP, Nairobi, January 7)  D'Agostino, an outspoken U.S. priest who runs an AIDS orphanage in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, made a daring move of taking the Kenyan government to court on behalf of infected children to force public schools into dropping their exclusion of HIV-infected children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Although 2.5 million people are estimated to have HIV in the country, AIDS and HIV are still taboo topics in Kenya. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> D'Agostino runs the Nyumbani orphanage and takes in many HIV-positive children.  He claimed that many of his charges have been denied admission to elementary schools.  The practice by these school authorities is a violation of the government's policy of obligatory universal primary education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Namwamba, D'Agostino's lawyer, told the court presided over by Judge Koome: "Denying children their admission to public schools, especially those infected with HIV, is inhuman, unlawful and is a gross violation of human rights.  Access to education is a basic right, and rejecting these children is a violation of their rights." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> D'Agostino is seeking a court order to compel public schools to admit children regardless of their HIV status. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Bremer made this gesture of reconciliation at a time when the occupying coalition is making every effort to appease pent-up grudges of the Sunnis to which Hussein belonged. </seg>
<seg id=9> Hussein was captured alive by the U.S. military eight months after he was on the run. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> LURD held an uprising against the former President Taylor's regime in 1999, starting a four-year civil war in Liberia and eventually controlling about four-fifths of the countrys territory. </seg>
<seg id=4> In mid-August last year, Taylor agreed to go in exile in Nigeria, paving the way for an agreement on peace and coalition government to be reached in this country.   Pursuant to the agreement, the former government, rebel forces and opposition parties formed a transitional government. </seg>

<seg id=3> Through this foundation, the Democratic Progress Party hopes to work together with democratic parties in other countries, share its experience of promoting democracy with other countries and make its contribution to the peace, stability and prosperity in Asia so that our ideal of establishing "Asian Democratic Alliance" will be realized as soon as possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In a rapidly changing world, a slightest shift in the balance of power in the region would affect the entire area, putting the security of all countries under test. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the Asia Pacific region, North Korea, complacent about its possession of nuclear weapons, has repeatedly test-fired missiles that flew over Japans airspace since the United States started the war on Iraq last month.  In addition, China has long been actively expanding its military arsenal and has deployed ballistic missiles aiming at Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id=6> All this has posed grave threats to the security of Taiwan and Japan as well as the rest of Asia Pacific region. </seg>

<seg id=1> This is an important moment today that encourages us to continue pushing forward with the reform.  We hereby express our appreciation in acknowledgement of all the efforts by our party members in demonstrating the will of this party and their joint efforts in achieving the goals of the reform. </seg>
<seg id=2> "The withdrawal of political parties from radio and television stations" is not only the most basic requirement for the implementation of media reform but also a concept the DPP has always adhered to.  That our party is in power should mean the reform will be accelerated, not that we become a hurdle or a burden to the reform. </seg>
<seg id=3> We also understand that in order to promote this goal, elected public officials in our party should take the lead in withdrawing themselves from media businesses.  This will be a small step toward media reform but it will also be a crucial step. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> During the era of the martial law when media was monopolized, many party members, in order to gain access to open public forum, engaged themselves in such difficult tasks as establishing the fourth TV station and local radio stations, through which they hoped to break the existing restrictions and help promote the reform of the media environment. </seg>
<seg id=5> For example, Comrade Trong Chai spent much time and energy in those days in establishing the fourth terrestrial television station and eventually founded "Formosa Television." </seg>
<seg id=6> This action brought a significant impact on the entire media environment particularly in that it shattered the longtime monopoly of the three stations and provided more space for the development of cable television stations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> However, we must understand that due to the historical limitation, there were many things that were done because they had to be done in the course of promoting the reform.  Therefore, when the media is completely open and free today, it means we have accomplished the mission set for that phase.  To allow the reform to continue its course, we must make choices as to what to keep and what to sacrifice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Central Standing Committee declared that all elected public officials in our party should withdraw themselves completely from their media businesses by the next session of the Legislative Yuan, namely, September 5, so as to set an example of fulfilling their promise to the people. </seg>
<seg id=9> We are very much pleased that all of you can give priority to the ideal and goal of the Party. People like Trong Chai, Chang Chun-hung, Chou Ching-yu, Hou Shui-sheng, Kao Meng-ting, Huang Nai-hui and Shen Ming-kung and others, who made a great deal of contribution during the democratic movement, are all able to sacrifice their minor individual interest in favor of promoting the media reform. </seg>

<seg id=3> This is because it is always our belief that only people are the masters of this country, and the DPP's duty is to elevate the party's founding principles of "integrity, diligence and love for the homeland" to the bright vision of "reform, progress and good life," and lay the foundation for a lasting peace and stability for 23 million Taiwanese people. </seg>

<seg id=1> Since the founding of New China, the Chinese government has always placed a great emphasis on developing relations with Africa and has formulated a series of guidelines and policies in this respect. </seg>
<seg id=2> We always adhere to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and respect African countries' independence and autonomy in their choice of political system and way of development.  We provide African countries assistance within our capabilities and carry out economic and technological cooperation.  We support the solidarity and cooperation among African countries and their alliance for self empowerment.  We urge the international community to pay attention to the peace and development in Africa and support the equal participation of African countries in international affairs.  We reinforce the consultation and cooperation between China and Africa and jointly safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries. </seg>

<seg id=5> Chinese experts, doctors, teachers and workers dispatched to Africa work shoulder by shoulder with the people there and get along well with them like real brothers and sisters. </seg>
<seg id=6> In international affairs, China and African countries understand and support each other and become partners who trust each other. </seg>

<seg id=8> In recent years, officials at various levels and in various fields in China and Africa have built increasingly deeper mutual political trust.  Achievements have been made in economic cooperation and trade.  The friendly exchanges in culture and education, health, science and technology, sports and other fields are thriving.  The China-Africa Cooperation Forum established at the beginning of this century has provided a new platform for the development of China-Africa relations and the deepening of cooperation. </seg>

<seg id=2> For this goal, we have tried our best, demonstrated our utmost sincerity and done a great deal of work. </seg>
<seg id=3> However, our efforts are challenged by Taiwan authorities and the forces of "Taiwan's independence." </seg>

<seg id=1> Taiwan authorities claim: "In order to prevent China from invading Taiwan by force and unilaterally changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, we must push for the March 20 peace referendum." </seg>
<seg id=2> This is a vilification of the Mainland's peace efforts as well as a provocation of the cross-Strait relations. </seg>
<seg id=3> At present, the real threat to Taiwan's security does not come from the Mainland but from the unbridled "Taiwan's independence" separatist activities staged by Taiwan authorities. </seg>
<seg id=4> It is none other than the separatist forces that are the direct cause of undermining the status quo in the cross-Strait relations and jeopardizing the peace in the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id=5> Taiwan authorities distort the Chinese mainland's opposition to "Taiwan's independence" and its preservation of the stability across the Taiwan Strait as attempts to attack and crush the democracy and freedom in Taiwan and use them as an excuse to launch the referendum. </seg>
<seg id=6> This is a groudless accusation turning the truth upside down and aiming to fraudulently gain sympathy and support for their continuous promotion of separatism. </seg>
<seg id=7> Taiwan authorities claim the upcoming referendum as so called "defensive referendum" and "peace referendum."  Yet however packaged, this act of provocation will only increase the cross-Strait hostility and hatred, intensifying the cross-Strait tension and pushing the cross-Strait relations step by step to the brink of danger. </seg>
<seg id=8> This completely runs counter to Taiwan compatriots' mainstream aspiration for peace, stability and development.  Instead of deepening "democratization" in Taiwan, it  misleads and manipulates the Taiwan people.  It is also a serious threat to peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region and will surely meet with universal opposition by people across the Strait and by the international community. </seg>

<seg id=3> I strongly agree with what Chairman Chen just said.  After thirty years, not only consumers have become clearly aware of their own rights and interests, but also their rights and interests are valued by all sectors of society.  This is the result of hard work by both the Consumer Council and the government. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> The Consumer Council tests products periodically, conducts market surveys on various products and services, and studies industrial operations.  Through its monthly "Choice," it releases fair and objective market information to the public. </seg>
<seg id=5> The monthly "Choice" has won the trust of citizens.  Now that the monthly "Choice" is developing its online version, it will play its role more efficiently in assisting consumers to access market information more conveniently and quickly. </seg>

<seg id=6> The hard work has not only laid a solid foundation for the gold market in Hong Kong but also contributed even more to the consolidation of Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. </seg>

<seg id=7> As the old saying goes that "make your plan for the year in spring," I hope all my colleagues at the Gold & Silver Exchange Society will continue to work hard in the coming year, seize the "golden" time of the gold and silver industry, take hold of the demand for gold trade brought about by the gold market reform in the Mainland, China's accession to the WTO and CEPA, and further promote the market development. </seg>
<seg id=8> I believe that with my colleagues' active promotion, the gold market in Hong Kong will surely have brilliant performance in the coming year. </seg>

<seg id=1> Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the global attention has focused on the security at seaports, airports and borders. </seg>
<seg id=2> As the port of origin in the world that ships the largest number of containers to the United States, Hong Kong undoubtedly responded promptly to the "Container Security Initiative" put forward by the United States. </seg>
<seg id=3> In addition, we believe that cutting off the life line of terrorist groups can also be an effective measure to stop terrorist activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Every day, large sums of funds flowing in and out of the global financial system have always puzzled the law enforcement agencies that target criminal profit-making and money laundering. </seg>
<seg id=5> As a key financial center in Asia, we believe cutting off funds of terrorists may be the most effective way to destroy their network from its very foundation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At present, Hong Kong's legislative body is discussing various proposals for improvement so as to tighten the existing laws and regulations that aim at cracking down on terrorist funding.  It is also amending laws and regulations in active compliance with the international standards and situation such as the new proposal by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. </seg>
<seg id=7> Besides, we are also trying to draw up a better information disclosure law to make it easier for agencies and individuals to report suspicious transactions. </seg>
<seg id=8> "Balance" is also the key in this job: Valid investigation right, freedom and personal privacy protected by the constitution, and efficiency of economic and financial systems are all factors that must be considered. </seg>

<seg id=1> In fact, the service sector in Hong Kong has advantages in many aspects. </seg>
<seg id=2> Professionals and commercial service personnel in Hong Kong have a deep understanding of the business operations both in mainland China and the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id=3> Professional services in Hong Kong like accounting, finance, law, arbitration, etc. are the best partners for the mainland businesses in their globalization and getting in line with the world market. </seg>
<seg id=4> Our transport, construction, designing and market promotion, management consulting, information science and technology, conventions and exhibitions and other services, on the other hand, can help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of the mainland enterprises and assist them in developing strategies for market promotion of products and improving brand images. </seg>
<seg id=5> Services like tourism, healthcare and insurance can all the more assist in the development of the related markets and industries in the Mainland and improve their quality of service. </seg>
<seg id=6> The close cooperation between service industries in Hong Kong and the Mainland will greatly enhance the existing advantages each has now and help both in taking the opportunities and challenges brought about by the economic globalization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> In order to promote the development of professional service industries in the mainland market, Secretary for Finance and I, together with officials from the Policy Bureaux and Administration Division and several representatives from different professional industries, just had substantive and valuable discussions in Beijing last week on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other topics of interest to the business community with the relevant departments and counterpart industries in the Mainland. </seg>
<seg id=8> I am very pleased that we have taken the first important step toward the business development of the mainland market by signing the agreements on mutual recognition of qualifications and cooperation in the three professional industries of construction, structural engineering and insurance. </seg>
<seg id=9> Through this meeting, the professional industries in Hong Kong have also established closer relations with the regulatory agencies in the Mainland and laid a good foundation for the friendly cooperation in the next stage. </seg>

<seg id=1> I believe the great majority of Hong Kong citizens love the motherland and love Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id=2> In fact, either before or after its return to China, Hong Kong has always had very close and interdependent economic, social, political and cultural ties with the Mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In the economic field, Hong Kongs industry has had a chance to move north and gained new space for development since our country instituted the four modernization programs, implemented reforms and the opening up more than two decades ago.  This, as we can see, has brought Hong Kong community into closer touch with the Mainland. </seg>
<seg id=4> Recently, we have another chance to make an arrangement with the Central Government for closer economic and trade relations so that various service sectors in Hong Kong can have new opportunities to participate more actively and more extensively in the economic development in the Mainland and to make a new round of contributions to our country and Hong Kong.  This will also bring Hong Kong and the Mainland closer together. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> In social development, we see the country has been making phenomenal progress in recent years. </seg>
<seg id=6> Hong Kong citizens were very excited when they saw Beijings successful bid for hosting the 2008 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id=7> A few months earlier, they were equally excited when Yang Weili paid a visit to Hong Kong.  Why is so? </seg>

<seg id=2> Likewise, the government has also been pondering over the long-term plan of relocating the government headquarters for more than a decade. </seg>
<seg id=3> Therefore, I understand the government's decision to postpone the Tamar Project which includes the new Legislative Council Complex will certainly disappoint some of the legislators. </seg>
<seg id=4> I know that the legislators will have to suffer some inconvenience by continuing to work in a less than satisfactory place for this period of time. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, just as I said to my colleagues in the government who are also affected by this decision, I hope everybody can give priority to public interests, understand the factors involved and exercise more patience during this period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Earlier I explained many times to the Legislative Council Commission that after considering the current fiscal situation and the financial status in the wake of the SARS outbreak last year, the government does not consider it an appropriate time now to proceed with the Tamar Project or any large-scale office building project. </seg>
<seg id=7> Postponing the project of the new Legislative Council Complex at Tamar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government in the coming years.  It is in the public interests and is also accepted by the public. </seg>

<seg id=1> The last point is the notion of "Hong Kong governed by the people of Hong Kong" that everybody has become familiar with recently.  This system requires that Hong Kong be governed by the people of Hong Kong, the majority of whom are patriots. </seg>
<seg id=2> There are also clear-cut standards for being patriots.  They should be those people of Hong Kong who respect their own nation, sincerely support the restoration of our country's sovereignty over Hong Kong and refrain from doing anything detrimental to our country and Hong Kong.  It is these patriots that make the majority of the government who should govern Hong Kong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> I must reiterate that the people of Hong Kong as a whole are patriotic. </seg>
<seg id=4> What is referred to here is not the ordinary Hong Kong citizens but those individuals who participate in the management of public affairs in Hong Kong and hold key positions in the administrative body, the Legislative Council and the judicial branch. </seg>
<seg id=5> When they are sworn into office, they must show their support for the "Basic Law" of Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the "Basic Law" and pledge their allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> The above five or six principles and their serious considerations I have talked about are actually the set of long-term guidelines and policies that had been set forth as early as in the 1980s when people started to talk about the distant future of Hong Kong, worked on "the Joint Declaration" and finalized the "Basic Law."  It has so far remained unchanged and will never be changed.  Since it is a series of long-term guidelines and policies governing our countrys restoration of sovereignty over Hong Kong and it is our state policy, it will never be changed. </seg>

<seg id=1> Several hundred years after its establishment, especially since the Industrial Revolution, the system of intellectual property has brought forth a succession of major inventions of epoch-breaking significance. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the recent two decades, the system of intellectual property has become the basic legal system and important policy and measure for various countries in promoting technological innovation and has played a key role in boosting their economy and enhancing their international competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id=3> At present, with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization, the quantity and quality of intellectual property ownership as well as the creation, possession and application of knowledge and intellectual resources have become the important foundation for all countries in participating in the international competitions. </seg>
<seg id=4> Therefore, stepping up the international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection is of great importance to the establishment of a just and reasonable new international economic order, and to the promotion of the global economic prosperity and development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Chinese government lays great emphasis on intellectual property protection. </seg>
<seg id=6> Our country started to establish the system of intellectual property in the early stage of our reform and opening up.  After more than two decades of hard work, we have developed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property and established a system of intellectual property protection which combines both judicial and executive branches.  We have done a great deal of work in the area of intellectual property protection and made an important contribution to the progress of science and technology and economic and social development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> As the world entered the information age in the 21st century, science and technology will promote the development of mans productivity with unprecedented force. </seg>
<seg id=8> For our country to expand opening up to the outside world in the new century, it is necessary to further improve our system of intellectual property and strengthen international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection.  It is also necessary for the construction of a modern socialist country and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. </seg>
<seg id=9> We are willing to work together with various countries in the world to establish a system of intellectual property, which is just, reasonable and conducive to the promotion of science and technology and economic development in all countries, and to create a good environment in which all the people respect knowledge, advocate science and protect intellectual property. </seg>

<seg id=1> Education is the cornerstone of the modern civilization. </seg>
<seg id=2> To enhance the overall quality of the people in our country and increase total national capabilities, education must be vigorously promoted. </seg>
<seg id=3> Rural education has a wide range of impact and affects the overall rural economy and social development. </seg>
<seg id=4> Since the reform and opening up, tremendous and profound changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas in our country.  This owes a great deal to the education, especially the rural education. </seg>
<seg id=5> The implementation in rural areas of the family contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated the productive forces. </seg>
<seg id=6> One of the underlying reasons why advanced and practical farming technologies can be extensively applied, why rural enterprises can suddenly emerge as a new force, and why the surplus labor in rural areas can have a massive migration to the coastal areas and towns and cities is that they are all backed by a rural labor force of hundreds of millions of people who have received obligatory education.  Credit should be given to universal obligatory education in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id=7> At present, the agriculture and rural economy in our country are in a crucial stage of development.  The development of high quality, high efficient, ecologically-friendly and safe agriculture, the expansion of industrialized agriculture and the relocation of rural surplus labor force all make it an urgent need to fully raise the overall qualification of rural labor force. </seg>
<seg id=8> The emergence in the world of a revolution in new science and technology and the progress made in building an overall well-to-do society have raised higher demands for the scientific, cultural, ideological and moral qualifications of the vast majority of rural population. </seg>
<seg id=9> Without the implementation of universal compulsory 9th grade education in rural areas and comprehensive enhancement of qualification of peasants, it would be very hard to realize an overall well-to-do society. </seg>
<seg id=10> We must fully recognize that rural education constitutes a fundamental, precursory and integral part of our efforts to building an overall well-to-do society. </seg>

<seg id=1> Recently, Iraq's interim Governing Council and the U.S. occupying authorities signed an agreement in Baghdad, announcing a timetable for a step-by-step transfer of power to hand over the government back to Iraq by June next year. </seg>
<seg id=2> This agreement was reluctantly approved by the international community: Although the meeting of the EU foreign ministers welcomed the move, France considered "the process too slow;" while Annan, the UN secretary general, felt encouraged about this plan of power transfer, he said "its still premature" for the United Nations to play its role in Iraq; Russia, on the other hand, flatly contested the legitimacy of the agreement. </seg>
<seg id=3> The Iraqis gave a cold response; public opinions in the United States even consider it "a big gamble." </seg>
<seg id=4> In short, most people are still somewhat skeptical and choose to wait and see. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It is not without reason that the international community has so many doubts. </seg>
<seg id=6> As people see it, the United States is not returning power to Iraq out of its own accord.  It is therefore impossible to have a complete transfer of power and there are bound to be many unexpected developments. </seg>
<seg id=7> First, the interim transitional government set to be established in May next year is not to be directly elected by the Iraqi people but will be elected by the "transitional National Assembly" that is selected by 18 governorate selection caucuses. </seg>
<seg id=8> This will be hard to be free from suspicion of the U.S. control and its legitimacy may be questioned. </seg>

<seg id=1> The U.S. government announced on November 18 that it had decided to impose quotas on three types of textile imports from China, namely: knit fabric, brassieres and dressing gowns. </seg>
<seg id=2> At a time when China is continuing its efforts to expand the economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States, it is deeply regrettable that the U.S. government should take this measure of trade protectionism. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> At this phase of economic globalization, the new quotas the United States imposes on Chinas textile imports are out of accord with the times. </seg>
<seg id=4> First, this abuse of "quotas" hinders the implementation of the WTO's principle of free trade. </seg>
<seg id=5> Isnt it too arbitrary and unfair to give pompous talks on free trade while backstabbing others with quotas at every opportunity in order to rebuild trade barriers? </seg>
<seg id=6> Second, "quotas" set a cap on the trend of development toward wholesome economic and trade relations between China and the United States. </seg>
<seg id=7> Since China and the United States reached an agreement in 1999 on China's accession to the WTO, the U.S. exports to China have enjoyed an average annual increase of 15%. </seg>

<seg id=1> There are many reasons why Bush's visit to the U.K. did not accomplish its goal.  The most important one is that after the Cold War was over, the United States has become the only superpower in the world, which has led to its total disregard of others and excessive unilateralism. </seg>
<seg id=2> The United States launched the war on Iraq without the UN authorization.  With no respect for the opinions of its chief allies on major international issues such as the rebuilding of Iraq, the United States persists in its own ways and has thus roused everybodys fury. </seg>
<seg id=3> A poll survey recently released by the EU Commission shows that 68% of the EU citizens think the United States did not have adequate justification to launch the war on Iraq and 53% believe the United States now poses a threat to the world peace. </seg>
<seg id=4> Second, although the United States lays emphasis on fighting terrorism and wants its allies to contribute human and financial resources, it turns a deaf ear to their concerns. </seg>
<seg id=5> With a firm hold on Iraq's reconstruction projects, the United States gave major contracts in the first bid to the corporations in its own country, unwilling to share even a tiny piece of the pie with others.  As for the dispute on the steel trade, the WTO ruled that the United States' high tariffs have violated the regulations.  People in the U.K. business circles had hoped Bush might make concessions during this visit, yet the United States eventually failed to clearly state its position. </seg>
<seg id=6> Third, the United States put its own values as supreme guidelines above those of all other nations.  Its insistence that Middle East countries carry out democratic reforms has been censured.  Some allies request that the United States respect the culture and special features of Islamic countries.  They believe that one of the reasons that the United States is deeply bogged down in Iraq is exactly the dire consequence of its "disrespect." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> However, Bush will not change his ways just because of the widespread criticism and opposition.  During this visit, he again defended his Iraq policy and emphasized that the U.S.-British coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with the violence in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=8> Since Bush's visit to the U.K. failed to accomplish its goal, the situation in Iraq will not necessarily develop the way the White House hopes for. </seg>

<seg id=1> After more than six months of debate, an advance contingent of Japan's Self-Defense Forces finally headed for Iraq before the end of 2003. </seg>
<seg id=2> This is the first time since the end of World War II that Japan has sent troops to overseas battlefields. </seg>
<seg id=3> It reflects the will of Japan in becoming a political and military power and also signals a shift in its defense strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The reason why this trip of the SDF has drawn so much attention is that it is not an isolated case. </seg>
<seg id=5> Taking advantage of the war in Afghanistan, Japan made the breakthrough of letting the SDF go outside Japan. By using the problem in the Korean peninsula as an excuse, Japan passed the "Crisis Legislation," making preparations for the SDF's use of force or even preemptive strikes.  Recently, the Koizumi cabinet again passed "The Basic Plan for Iraqi Reconstruction Assistance," paving the way for the military dispatch to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=6> Step by step, this finally led to the breakthrough of the restriction of Japan's pacifist constitution and military deployment to overseas battlefields. </seg>
<seg id=7> In addition, Japan is also going to amend "Concept of Basic Defense Force" so that military deployment overseas can be made legal and permanent.  It also plans to establish a "regular force" for overseas deployment that is not formed on contingency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Meanwhile, the Japanese cabinet meeting, citing the so-called "threat of North Korea's missiles as a reason, decided to start the deployment of the missile defense system by early 2004.  It imports the U.S.-made "Standard 3 missiles" and "Patriot PAC-3" missiles to intercept exoatmospheric missiles and those returning to the atmosphere in order to build a two-tiered missile interception network. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is easy to see that Japan's SDF is evolving into a regular military force "for offensive as well as defensive purposes."  It seems that the so-called "SDF" "exclusively for defensive purposes" is going to exist in name only. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The reason why these actions by Japan have drawn so much attention is mainly because these military decisions are a challenge to Japans pacifist constitution. </seg>

<seg id=4> The purpose of my visit is to pray for peace and prosperity of Japan." </seg>
<seg id=5> We would like to ask whether Koizumi's so-called "sacrifices of the war" include Class A World War II criminals such as Hideki Tojo. </seg>
<seg id=6> Does it mean Class A war criminals also made their fundamental contribution to the peace and prosperity in the post-war Japan? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Some reporter asked why January 1 was chosen for his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id=8> Koizumi said it is the Japanese tradition to go to worship at the shrine on the first day of the new year and many people pay a visit to the shrine on this day. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is understandable that ordinary people mourn for their loved ones and friends, and many survivors clearly expressed their opinion that their visit to the shrine is only for the purpose of remembering their loved ones and friends and that they strongly oppose honoring Class A war criminals at the Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Chinese are a reasonable people.  We have always insisted on differentiating the Japanese people from a handful of militarists and the ordinary public from the right wing.  Ordinary people's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine is not the root cause of this historical issue. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International)  Flu Outbreak Peaks in U.S. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, December 31 (Reporter Yan Liang)  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on the 31st that the worst flu in the United States in more than 30 years has peaked.  Widespread influenza activities have been reported in 45 of the 50 U.S. states and the number of flu deaths has rapidly risen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> According to the CDC statistics as of December 20, the number of flu deaths in the United States has hit a record high, accounting for 7.8% of all deaths during the same period. </seg>
<seg id=4> In the United States, at least 42 children have died of the flu, and the number of adult flu deaths is also rapidly rising though accurate statistics are not available at this moment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to experts, there are two reasons why the flu became epidemic in 2003:  first, since the flu virus is not the type of "Panama A" common in the past years, the vaccines manufactured earlier cannot offer effective protection against the virus; and second, a surplus of flu vaccines last year in the United States has led two major vaccine suppliers to reduce this year's production to 83 million doses, causing a vaccine shortage this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although on average, 36,000 people die of the flu and 114,000 people are hospitalized with flu each year in the United States, it is rare for the flu to cause such public alarm as this year's. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to William Thompson, a U.S. epidemiologist, this flu is the worst in the United States in more than 30 years and it has also come earlier than usual.  Quite a number of schools have reported widespread flu activities and long lines have formed at many flu vaccination stations. </seg>
<seg id=8> In response to such serious situation, the U.S. Department of Health activated its emergency operations center on December 19 and dispatched teams of medical experts to all states. </seg>

<seg id=2> The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced on January 16 that as of the end of September last year, the debt the United States owed various types of foreign creditors hit a total of 6.494 trillion U.S. dollars, up 2.2% over the figure last released. </seg>

<seg id=2> U.S. President Reagan once made a lengthy list of crimes for Libya's leader Qaddafi, accusing Libya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and engaging in external military intervention and terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=3> As the verbal attacks between the two sides escalated to military actions, the United States launched two surgical air strikes against Libya called "Prairie Fire" and "El Dorado Canyon." </seg>
<seg id=4> Since then, the United States had put Libya under economic sanctions, political attacks, diplomatic constraints and military threats. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, Qaddafi did not give in under pressures. </seg>

<seg id=6> Now seeing a thaw in the relations between the United States and Libya, some people attributed it entirely to the deterrent effect of the Iraq war.  This seems to be rather biased. </seg>

<seg id=1> From February 7 to February 8, top politicians in Europe, the United States and the rest of the world gathered in Munich, Germany, to attend the 40th Munich Conference on Security Policy. </seg>
<seg id=2> The so-called "Munich Conference on Security Policy" is an international forum on security founded by a non-government individual and funded by the German government.  In recent years, it has gained increasing attention especially after the Sept.11 attacks and has been honored as the "Davos Forum" on security. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> One of the major topics for the conference this time is transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id=4> The remarks by the top European and U.S. politicians either at the conference or outside the conference showed that both sides are trying their best to get rid of the dark shadow that the Iraq war has brought over their relations and are making every effort to resume their cooperation. </seg>

<seg id=1> The United States has the most advanced modern media and monopolizes a substantial part of international press.  The extent of Its propaganda has long reached every corner of the world and has virtually become ubiquitous.  Why does it want to spend huge investment now in setting up a satellite television network that covers specifically the 22 countries across the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id=2> Quoting the head of "Alhurra" TV station, it is to provide Arab countries a news platform of "comprehensive and fair viewpoints." </seg>
<seg id=3> However, some analysts pointed out that "Alhurra" will be the strategic weapon used by the United States to carry out media infiltration, cultural invasion and psychological warfare in Arab countries.  It is an important propaganda tool for the United States to implement its policy of restructuring the Middle East and reforming the Islamic world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In that sense, "Alhurra" has an extraordinary mission which chiefly consists of three major points.  The first is to spread "the concept of freedom." </seg>
<seg id=5> The United States considers the Islamic civilization a serious hurdle to the promotion of the modern Western civilization.  The religious extremist forces in the Islamic countries in the Middle East are the breeding ground for the international terrorism that has a distinctive feature of anti-Americanism.  In order to effectively combat terrorism, the Islamic world must be reformed so that it will identify with and accept the Western values, style of life and political system. </seg>
<seg id=6> Through the subtle influence of "Alhurra" programs, the United States attempts to instill its own ideology in Arabs. </seg>
<seg id=7> The second is to improve the U.S. image. </seg>
<seg id=8> Externally, the United States adopts unilateralism and acts like a bully in whatever way it wants on many international issues.  Such hegemony has infuriated the Arab countries and Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id=9> After the Sept.11 attacks, the conflict escalated between the United States that has persistently favored Israel and the Islamic world in the Middle East. </seg>

It is a demonstration of the precious sincerity for peace on both sides. </seg>

<seg id=3> Prior to this meeting, most analysts were still cautious about the prospects of peace process though the relations between the two countries are thawing at a series of goodwill gestures from both sides, . </seg>

<seg id=8> Furthermore, after experiencing a series of ebb and flow of the bilateral relations, both countries agree that war is not a good solution to disputes and that both should stay away from war.

<seg id=3> People still remember that in order to show its concern for Africa, the Bush administration set forth a "President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief" in January last year and promised to provide at least 3 billion U.S. dollars each year to Africa. </seg>
<seg id=4> In July last year, President Bush successively visited five African countries of Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria and pledged 15 billion U.S. dollars in assisting African countries in their prevention and treatment of AIDS and another 100 million U.S. dollars for fighting terrorist activities in Africa.  Other Africa aid programs such as food emergency program and education assistance program were also announced. </seg>
<seg id=5> These aid programs were once greatly welcomed by African countries and won quite a lot of international acclaim. </seg>

In order to realize the "Millennium Development Goals" set forth by the United Nations in 2000, work hard to reduce hunger and poverty, and promote health and education, Africa founded the "African Union" to take overall charge of African affairs and established "The New Partnership for Africa's Development" aimed at promoting development in all countries.  However, due to poor financial resources, lack of development funds has always been a problem. </seg>
<seg id=9> The United Nations has repeatedly called for the developed countries to allocate 0.7% of their GNP to be used as official aid to the most underdeveloped countries. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, with its official aid only accounting for 0.1% of its GNP, the United States has far failed the UN requirement and ranked at the bottom of the list of donor countries. </seg>

<seg id=1> Recently, the European media has been discussing a hot topic: whether the "big three" summit of German Chancellor Schoder, French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair is gradually institutionalized. </seg>
<seg id=2> The media calls the "big three" of Germany, France and Britain the EU's "new troika" and the relations among the three countries the "new triangular relations." </seg>
<seg id=3> The "new triangle" is a new phenomenon.  It remains to be observed as to where it is going.  However, no matter from what perspective, the "new triangle" overall seems to be conducive to the unification of Europe and therefore will help Europe to play an important role as one pole of the multi-polar world in the international arena. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A survey of European history of a hundred years shows that the triangular relations among Germany, France and Britain have one basic characteristic: the alliance between Britain and France in controlling or opposing Germany. </seg>
<seg id=5> Two world wars are the proofs. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the era of Cold War, both East Germany and West Germany were respectively constrained by Warshaw Convention and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. </seg>
<seg id=7> After the Cold War ended, the unified Germany became even more powerful, causing an imbalance of power in West Europe.  The growing suspicion of France led to the temporary malfunctioning of Germany-France axis.  As a result, Britain and France got close again with the same old intention of controlling Germany. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, with "Germany-France axis" back into operation and the fierce conflict between the concepts of the unipolarization and multipolarization of the world, the EU has become seriously divided internally on the issue of Iraq in recent years. </seg>
<seg id=9> The "old Europe" represented by Germany and France holds exactly the opposite position from that of "new Europe" represented by Britain and Poland on the issue of the Iraq war. </seg>

<seg id=3> Among them, the publication of the "Secondary School Olympic Reader" chiefly for youth readership is one of the most important achievements. </seg>
<seg id=4> The book, rich both in illustration and text, provides a systematic and vivid introduction of the Olympic Movement and the essence of the Olympic spirit mainly through story telling.

<p>
<seg id=5> Last year, BOCOG also designed a schedule of classes specially for young students that is printed on recycled paper with the logo of Beijing Olympic Games. </seg>

<seg id=2> It basically means to significantly enhance the environmental quality of the capital, create a beautiful environment for the Olympic Games and build an ecologically-friendly city. </seg>
<seg id=3> To achieve these goals, we must extensively adopt environmental protection technologies and measures, proceed with a large-scale environmental treatment in various aspects and with afforestation and beautification of urban and rural areas, and promote the development of the environmental protection industry.  We must constantly raise public awareness of environmental protection and encourage everyone to actively participate in various activities aimed to improve the ecological environment. </seg>

<seg id=2> Of course, there are still some countries that have seen great improvements in their human rights conditions, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, but these are the "achievements" of the U.S. military in overthrowing the former regimes and "liberating" the two countries. </seg>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen to Implement Health and Quarantine Inspection of Exiting and Entering Drivers against SARS </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, January 8 (Li Nanling and Hong Wen)  In order to effectively prevent the contagious SARS disease from spreading through Shenzhen's ports of entry and safeguard public health, Shenzhen Inspection and Quarantine Bureau recently issued a public notice, deciding to implement a full range of health and quarantine measures effective on the 9th such as requiring all drivers passing through the three land ports of entry at Huanggang, Wenjingdu and Shatoujiao to take their body temperatures and fill in health and quarantine cards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> It is known that quite a large number of vehicles pass Shenzhen's ports of entry.  For instance, a daily average of 25,000 vehicles pass the port of entry at Huanggang, and as many as 10,000 at Wenjingdu.  Therefore it is a daunting task to implement health checks of all drivers while keeping the ports of entry free from congestion. </seg>
<seg id=4> To ensure that all exiting and entering drivers have their temperatures taken and health and quarantine cards collected, Shenzhen Inspection and Quarantine Bureau overcame all kinds of difficulties.  Apart from dispatching internal employees to assist in the work at the frontline ports of entry, it has recently expedited the hiring of over 250 people and sent them all to work at the frontline after intensive training so as to ensure smooth traffic flow at ports of entry.  At the same time, the bureau also purchased additional 60 portable infrared instant temperature measuring devices to meet the need of the work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Shenzhen Inspection and Quarantine Bureau advises the relevant agencies and drivers who pass ports of entry that "Exit/Entry Health and Quarantine Cards" are available at the stations of the health and quarantine agencies at all ports of entry where "Exit/Entry Vehicles and Cargo(Passenger) Inspection and Quarantine Record Booklet" are exchanged or at the stations where temperatures are taken and health and quarantine cards are collected. </seg>
<seg id=6> The bureau also calls for active cooperation between the relevant agencies and passing drivers in carrying out this measure to effectively prevent SARS from spreading through Shenzhen ports of entry and safeguard the health of general public. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 8  The speech made by the president of European Central Bank led the U.S. dollar to plunge again on the 8th after its momentary rally on the 7th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet remarked on the very same day that the high exchange rate of the euro exerted a negative effect on the export industry in Europe; however, he believes that the impact of the appreciating euro has been partially offset by the gradual recovery of global economy and rising consumer spending. </seg>
<seg id=4> At the same time, he pointed out that the strong euro has also played an active role in stabilizing prices in the euro zone to a certain extent and therefore ECB decided to leave the previous interest rate unchanged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Taking this remark as a message that officials in the euro zone are not concerned about the rising euro, investors started a sell-off of the U.S. dollar, causing it to drop against all other major western currencies while pushing the British pound to rise against the U.S. dollar to a momentary new high in 11 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At the close of New York Currency Market on the 8th, the ratio of euro over dollar rose from 1:1.2640 the previous day to 1:1.2761; the British pound against U.S. dollar rose to 1:1.8320 from 1:1.8180 after a momentary rise as high as 1:1.8354; the U.S. dollar against Japanese yen dropped to 1:106.17 from 1:106.27; while the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc was down to 1:1.2267 from 1:1.2398. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 15  (Tie Ma)  In the past, historians always believed that the palace area in the village of Sunjianantou in Fengxiang County, Baoji City of Shaanxi Province became a site for major royal sacrificial offerings only after the Qin people relocated their capital to Yong City, but the recent accidental discovery of 31 Qin tombs in this palace area by Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archeology may be expected to change this belief. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> To meet the need of a company in Baoji City that plans to acquire the ruins for building its factory, Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archeology conducted an archeological investigation of the site, and in the urgently needed area of about 20,000 square meters, discovered 31 Qin tombs dating from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period. </seg>
<seg id=4> After the excavation team of Yong City, Shaanxi Province, cleaned up and excavated these ancient tombs, over 40 articles of bronze ware, pottery and other artifacts were uncovered. </seg>
<seg id=5> One of the Qin tombs contains two coffins and has a pit of two sacrificial horses near the tomb. </seg>
<seg id=6> In this tomb were uncovered 15 articles of bronze ware and pottery.  The bronze ware includes ancient freestanding cooking vessels, pots, axes, among others. </seg>
<seg id=7> Among them, the bronze cooking vessel was superbly fashioned with exquisite decorative lines in a well preserved style of cast bronze from the Western Zhou Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=8> Judging from the sacrificial objects, the owner of this tomb was a Qin aristocrat in late Western Zhou Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=9> Assuming that, experts believe there should be a large cluster of ancient tombs nearby. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 18 (Reporter Su Wanming)  A severed finger successfully preserved in liquid nitrogen of -196 degrees Celsius resumed its life after it was surgically replanted. </seg>
<seg id=3> Chinese scholars recently announced there has been a major breakthrough in the cryogenic preservation and replantation of severed fingers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Recently, the department of hand and foot surgery at Shandong Provincial Hospital again performed a successful finger replantation surgery for a patient (whose severed finger was preserved in liquid nitrogen of -196 degrees Celsius for five days.)  This is the second case of such surgery after the replantation of a severed finger (preserved in liquid nitrogen of -196 degrees Celsius for 81 days) was successfully performed at the hospital last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> A consultation report by the Ministry of Health that runs a search for new medical scientific technologies certifies that so far these are the only two surgeries in the world that succeeded in replanting severed fingers preserved in cryogenic temperature. </seg>
<seg id=6> Wang Zengtao, director of hand and foot surgery department at Shandong Provincial Hospital, announced: "After a large number of animal experimental studies and two clinical trials, we have basically mastered the technique of cryogenic preservation of severed fingers." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> According to Wang Zengtao's introduction, compared with organs such as heart and kidney, the composition and structure of a finger, is more complex, including blood vessels, nerves, tendons, skin, bone, joints, ligaments and various tissues that form a complex tissue. </seg>
<seg id=8> The technique of cryogenic preservation of severed fingers and its application involve a series of complex steps such as the formulation of freezing solution, the freezing procedure of organs, rewarming, replantation, and prevention and treatment of reperfusion injury. </seg>
<seg id=9> The mastery of this technique has provided important experiences to go by for the related research on long-term cryogenic preservation of other human organs and their successful revival. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Davos (Switzerland) January 23 (Reporters Li Jie and Ding Xigang)  At the 34th annual session of World Economic Forum being held in Davos, Switzerland, a special seminar was held on the trend of dollar devaluation on the 23rd.  Some experts predict that the United States will be the biggest winner if the exchange rate of U.S. dollar continues to slip. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Most participating economists think that U.S. officials including U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow seem to have already given up the "strong-dollar policy" which has been followed in recent years. </seg>
<seg id=4> The declining exchange rate of U.S. dollar will provide greater space for economic growth in the United States and more employment opportunities.  This is clearly evidenced in the manufacturing industry. </seg>
<seg id=5> Meanwhile, the dollar devaluation will make U.S. products more competitive both at domestic and international markets, helping the United States to make up for its trade deficit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> However, experts think that the weaker dollar can also exert a negative influence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id=7> First of all, the U.S. stock market will likely continue to decline.  With the devaluation of various kinds of investment, foreign investors will withdraw their funds for fear of further dollar devaluation.  Second, as imported goods become more and more expensive, the American people's living standards will eventually decline.  Third, any substantial dollar devaluation can also set off trade and financial turmoil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> However, the dollar devaluation will hit Europe, Japan and Canada even harder. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International)  WTO Submits "Byrd Subsidy" Dispute for Arbitration </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 26  (Reporter Li Jie)  WTO announced on the 26th that the petitions of the EU and other seven WTO members to impose sanctions on the United States for its implementation of "Byrd subsidy" have been submitted to the arbitration agency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The petitions for sanctions originated from the United States' failure to repeal "the Byrd Amendment" within the deadline set by WTO. </seg>
<seg id=4> "The Byrd Amendment" passed by the U.S. Congress in 2000 requires the U.S. government to subsidize the victimized U.S. companies directly with the punitive tariffs collected in the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases instead of sending them to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The U.S. move was opposed by its major trade partners including the EU and Japan. </seg>
<seg id=6> WTO finally ruled in January 2003 that the amendment violated the rules of the world trade and required the United States to repeal it by December 27 of the same year. </seg>
<seg id=7> But the United States did not implement the WTO ruling. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> As a result, the EU, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India, South Korea, Mexico and Chile recently submitted petitions to the WTO, requesting the permission to impose additional duties on some products originating in the United States in amounts equivalent to those of the U.S. government subsidies. </seg>
<seg id=9> However, the United States immediately challenged the extent of the sanctions and the validity of the petitions. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 28  Hong Kong Retail Management Association disclosed that retail sales in Hong Kong are doing pretty well during the lunar New Year.  The industry has seen an average of 10% increase of business revenue while some shopping centers have even enjoyed 20% to 30% increases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Yu Pengchun, chairman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, indicated the other day that mainland tourists taking personal trips to Hong Kong have helped in creating a shopping atmosphere in Hong Kong.  The retail sales during the Spring Festival are doing very well in Hong Kong.  Some sectors of the industry such as those of jewelry and apparel even enjoyed 20% to 30% increases of sales, with the spending of mainland tourists making up about 10% of the total business revenue. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said mainland tourists, using RMB credit cards in Hong Kong, have obviously stimulated the market in the Spring Festival. Each charge averaged 3,000 yuan.  Some mainland tourists even spent as much as over 10,000 yuan. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Last year, the total retail revenue in Hong Kong dropped 4% due to SARS. </seg>
<seg id=6> Yu Pengchun predicts that with the economic recovery, the total retail sales in Hong Kong will have a single-digit increase, but the price of merchandise will be under pressure for upward adjustment due to the cost increase. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, January 28, from Copenhagen:  The Danish government submitted to the Congress a new act that will limit immigration on the 28th. </seg>
<seg id=3> Under the act, children born in Denmark to foreign immigrants will no longer have the privilege of obtaining the Danish nationality automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The act is the latest of a series of measures to limit immigration since the Danish Freedom Party leader Rasmussen took office as prime minister in November 2001. </seg>
<seg id=5> It is reported that the act is likely to be passed at the Parliament because Freedom Party has gained the support of the right-wing Danish People's Party over the immigration issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The act requires that instead of obtaining the nationality automatically, foreign children born in Denmark apply for citizenship when they become adults just as other immigrants do. </seg>
<seg id=7> Naturalized immigrants will be deprived of their citizenship if they have committed criminal activities that are seriously detrimental to the society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> In the past two years, the Danish government has released a series of measures to limit immigration, including setting limits on issuing long-term residence cards and on immigrants' sponsorship of their relatives to come to Denmark. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Due to the Danish government's unfriendly attitude toward immigrants, the number of foreign refugees in Denmark dropped from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003. </seg>

<seg id=2> It is regrettable that there should be such a high frequency of accidents and heavy loss of human lives. </seg>
<seg id=3> A few months prior to this, a natural gas blowout at a drilling well in Chongqing, gas explosions at several coal mines and frequent serious road accidents had resulted in hundreds of deaths. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Due to a vast area and dense population, China has a higher probability of disasters than any other countries and the resulting death toll can easily reach tens or even hundreds.  Objectively, this is a helpless reality. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> Among so many disasters, fire, explosions in coal mines, blasts in fireworks factories, and traffic accidents are the most common. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> According to the statistics, a total of 99 maids of various nationalities died in accidental falls from buildings from January 1999 to June 2003. </seg>
<seg id=3> Behind these figures we see not only the broken families that waited in vain for the return of their daughters or mothers and the misfortunes that should have been avoided, but also the direction of our work to reduce these regrettable figures to the lowest possible level. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> According to a statement recently published by the Indonesian embassy, 96 Indonesian maids have died while working in Singapore since 1999.  Some of them fell to their death from tall buildings during work. </seg>
<seg id=5> The Indonesian government expresses its complaints from time to time about the accidental falls of maids and also set forth new regulations several times so as to rigorously control the qualification of Indonesian maids in our country and ensure their safety.  However, the problem persists.  As a result, the bilateral relations between Singapore and Indonesia are inevitably troubled by this maid problem. </seg>

<seg id=1> Chen Kongli, a world renowned expert on Taiwan in the Mainland, recently published his new book entitled "Observing Taiwan." </seg>
<seg id=2> Most of articles collected in the book were all written in a period from the first rotation of political parties in Taiwan's government in March 2000 to Chen Shui-bian's assertion of "one country on each side of the Strait.  They are the author's observations and reflections of the internal situation in Taiwan and the cross-Strait relations during the time when he "listened to what one said and watched what one did." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Since it took two years for these articles written two years ago to be published, it is obvious that the Mainland has a very convoluted and time-consuming reviewing system for research papers on Taiwan.  This shows the publication of "Observing Taiwan" has gone through an uphill struggle. </seg>
<seg id=4> Since a long time ago, Chen Kongli has been taking an objective and truth-finding approach in his observation and study of Taiwan.  He did not restrict himself to any subjective and preconceived political framework and endeavored to explore unique and truthful insights. </seg>
<seg id=5> The reading of this book gives one an even deeper impression of this special characteristic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Since the early 1980s, the study on Taiwan has become the "popular study" in mainland China.  Various research institutes emerged one after another and all kinds of scholars and experts made their appearances and showed their talent. </seg>

<seg id=2> Not long ago, when Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian shouted "Let's win the election!" at a campaign rally somewhere in the north of the island, more than half of the audience did not give him the due respect of shouting with him because most of the local people have some relatives or friends who have gone to invest in the Mainland and the long overdue "three direct links" and the non-performing financial policy have many of them concerned. </seg>

<seg id=3> If nothing unexpected happens, we can assume from opinion polls, underground wagers and other signs at this countdown time to Taiwans presidential election that Chen-Lu team will lose the election. </seg>
<seg id=4> Unless more sensational developments come up, such as a major pan-blue split-up or an even more embarrassing scandal, Chen Shui-bian, who fought such a hard battle of winning the power from Lee Teng-hui, will have proved that he has failed to effectively win the popularity in the past four years and that instead he has allowed the green camp to stage a continuous variety show of corruption and low taste before the public, which has consequently weakened the confidence of his supporters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> How is Beijing going to deal with the pan-blue forces that may regain the power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> First of all, we should understand that the pan-blue camp that may possibly regain the power is no longer the single big dominant party of the KMT but a combination of the blue and the orange and that there is the issue whether the internal tradition and the native faction can merge. </seg>
<seg id=7> The current close cooperation during the election period cannot be regarded as necessary future relations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> If there are hopes of winning the election, internal restructuring will surely take considerable amount of time.  The ensuing election of the Legislative Yuan at the end of the year will also make it very hard for the Lien-Soong administration to make any major changes in the cross-Strait relations, </seg>
<seg id=9> unless it realizes that the improvement of the cross-Strait relations can score points for Taiwans internal politics and is also confident of producing a positive result within a short period of time which, most importantly, can be felt by the general public. </seg>

<seg id=1> More than half a century has passed since the United States conducted its first nuclear explosion in New Mexico in July 1945 and dropped two atomic bombs in Japan in August of the same year. </seg>
<seg id=2> Although the arms race between the two superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union led to a stockpile of nuclear weapons sufficient for the destruction of the entire world, fortunately both parties realized the danger of a nuclear war and refrained from pushing the nuclear button. </seg>
<seg id=3> After the Soviet Union was dissolved and the world entered the post-Cold-War era, the danger of a large-scale nuclear war basically disappeared. </seg>

<seg id=7> In the other case, some non-state groups, especially the Islamic extremists who harbor an intense hatred for the West, are also seeking small-size nuclear weapons by all means to carry out bloody terrorist attacks on the West with no regard to innocent civilians. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=8> In response to this demand, there have emerged middlemen who engage in the transfer and sales of nuclear weapons and the related technologies, and "nuclear black markets."

<seg id=2> This is a clear shift from the equivocal attitude toward this issue he has adopted for months and represents an important development in politics during the U.S. presidential election year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the newly emerged Republican headquarters in the American South, but it also has an enormous negative effect.  Since it is a heavyweight cultural dispute that divides public opinions nationwide, it doubtlessly will aggravate the political polarization in the United States and further distance the Liberal-dominated East and West coasts. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Moreover, as the young generation in the United States has become more and more liberal toward the homosexuality issue, this act of Bush, though effective in the short term, will do damages to the long-term interest of the Republican Party. </seg>
<seg id=6> Bush's new offensive of "constitutional amendment" can be described as his "scotched earth strategy" for this year's presidential election. </seg>

<seg id=6> The recent remarks made by some U.S. think tank personnel with government connections and the U.S. deployment of a large number of spy ships to the Taiwan Strait in the coming days to spy on the military activities of both sides of the Strait are indirect evidence that the United States is very much concerned with the situation in the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id=7> It shows from another perspective that although the United Stats will not completely prevent Taiwan from holding the referendum as Beijing requested, it is equally concerned with the uncertainty of the situation in the Taiwan Strait during this period. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Cheney, who always hides his talents and keeps a low profile, has made frequent public appearances lately in interviews with the media, denying that he will be replaced. </seg>
<seg id=4> But he still left some room for himself. </seg>
<seg id=5> He said he would not hesitate to bow out should he have health problems or feel himself a real burden on the president. </seg>
<seg id=6> Cheney, 63, has a history of four heart attacks. </seg>

<seg id=1> The competitors for the 2004 U.S. presidential election have been confirmed: the Democratic candidate Kerry challenging the incumbent Republican President Bush. </seg>
<seg id=2> They have started "warming up" activities such as campaign advertisements and election debates prior to the November election. </seg>
<seg id=3> Their confrontation either orally or in written form may center on the three major topics of war, economy and social issues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Bush believes that the war is closely linked with the national security of the United States.  Either sending troops to topple Saddam or fight against terror, it is all for the sake of ensuring the security of the United States.  Therefore, he tells his countrymen time and again: "We are at war." </seg>
<seg id=5> Kerry, of course, will point out that it is wrong for Bush to abuse the erroneous intelligence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction to launch the war on Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Speaking of economy, Kerry thinks Bush's tax relief plan helps the rich and fails to create new jobs. </seg>
<seg id=7> Bush shows Kerry: Aren't the U.S. economic figures going up? </seg>
<seg id=8> As for the social issues such as the relationship between man and woman, Bush opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, and supports death penalty, whereas,  Kerry is also aganist same-sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> How Bush and Kerry present their own viewpoints on these three major issues to the voters and convince them via ads, television and speeches will be all the political shows the two are going to put on for the next eight months. </seg>

<seg id=2> Academic pressure is generally believed to be the cause of child and teenage suicide.  However, studies find that emotional problems, especially those pertaining to sexual love and parental relationship, are actually the main reasons that local young people commit suicide. </seg>

<seg id=3> Academic pressure and disappointment resulting from failed expectation also certainly pertain to the category of communication between parents and children. </seg>
<seg id=4> The pressure of getting into a higher school is an inevitable burden on local school children during their growing up.  Sometimes the pressure is self-induced, while more often the pressure is imposed on children by their parents. </seg>
<seg id=5> Parents demand children have good academic performance and compare their own children with other children at every chance.  Although the demand of academic excellence puts quite a lot of pressure on children, the mediation and communication behind the pressure are the true indicators of the relationship between parents and children. </seg>
<seg id=6> If parents beat and scold their children or show blame on their faces when children's performance is less than perfect, or even make children feel they are disappointments, they will doubtlessly push their children to helplessness and desperation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Specifically, Beijing should urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons on the one hand, and start with reforming the Kim Jong Il regime and lead it toward modern civilization on the other so that it can eliminate the danger of a nuclear war in Northeast Asia and keep the status quo in the Korean peninsula, gaining more clout for long-term strategic negotiations with the United States. </seg>

<seg id=1> China's policy of reform and opening up started with agriculture.  Rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of this policy. </seg>
<seg id=2> However, in the late 1990s, the agricultural reform basically came to a standstill due to the dramatic shift in economic policy toward towns and cities, and the gap between urban and rural areas was further widened. </seg>
<seg id=3> As time passes, two entirely different worlds have emerged in China, one is the highly prosperous urban China, and the other is the impoverished rural China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> To use a Chinese official jargon, the widening gap between urban and rural areas in China is "an issue of development," and must therefore be solved through continued development. </seg>
<seg id=5> In other words, the development of the coastal areas and urban areas in China should continue without being hindered by the problems in rural areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> However, seeing some metropolitan cities undergoing small changes in a year and big changes in three years, people could not but ask why some impoverished areas have seen no changes in the past decades? </seg>
<seg id=7> Of course, we should recognize the fact that urban and rural areas have very different ways of development.  But the question is when large amount of funds are invested in urban construction and encouragement and support are given to the wealthy middle class, have rural residents, who make up 70% of the entire population, also been given the attention and emphasis? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> In theory, the Chinese governments, both past and present, have undeniably paid due attention to the issues of agriculture, rural areas and peasants. </seg>
<seg id=9> However, as the conditions in rural areas have been more and more deteriorating in recent years, the emphasis given is obviously less and less adequate. </seg>

<seg id=3> According to the latest report from the National Auditing Department, the audition of the financial expenditures in the public security agencies in 26 provinces and cities last year shows that the public security agencies in the country had illegally collected a total of 16.5 billion yuan in fines and penalties. </seg>

<seg id=3> However, the talks yielded no progress on those substantive issues like how North Korea should scrap its nuclear weapons program and how the United States should afterwards ensure the political and military security in North Korea and provide North Korea energy aid.
