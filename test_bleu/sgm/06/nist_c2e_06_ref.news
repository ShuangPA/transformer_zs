<p>
<seg id="2"> AFP on the 16th, New York </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Acknowledged as the most likely recipient of this year's Oscar for best actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, lead actor in the movie "Capote," disclosed that he had succumbed to drugs and alcohol when he was young and reckless.  Fortunately, he then succeeded in quitting and was able to start his top flight acting career. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In an interview on US CBS news magazine 60 Minutes, Hoffman softly sighed that in such period he would truly do anything to get drugs and alcohol. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At that time he was in his early 20s.  Having just graduated from New York University's drama program, he entered into a dazzling society where each day life was so fast-paced and vertiginous that he eventually got dizzy and lost control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When he was 22, he checked into a rehab center, where he kicked his alcohol and drug abuse habits.  In his whole life, that was the period of time when he felt most panicked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the upcoming Oscar Awards ceremony to be held next month, the movie "Capote," in which Hoffman's role portrays American writer Capote, is acknowledged to be the most likely winner of the best actor award. </seg>

<seg id="2"> AFP on the 16th, Brussels </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Panic strikes as signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The European Commission passed an additional measure to set up a "buffer zone" to fully administer the areas in countries where bird flu has been discovered, banning trade and transport of all poultry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Eight days after discovery of the pathogenic H5N1 virus in the African country of Nigeria, outbreaks continued to spread to more chicken farms, with signs indicating it has crossed the northern border into Niger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Egyptian officials are investigating a sudden incidence of mass chicken deaths on a chicken farm in the south, fearing that the virus may continue to spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With chicken markets in Europe plummeting from the impact of virus incidents, the European Commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to panic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Kyprianou, the European commissioner for health and food safety, said it is understandable that the public is concerned, but there is no need to overreact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Following an earlier measure creating three-kilometer protection zones and 10-kilometer surveillance zones around outbreaks of the virus, the European Commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a "buffer zone" in the entire region of Europe where the virus has been discovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> An EU official, who declined to be named, said that everyone is on high alert as they process from morning till night news of suspected outbreaks from around Europe. </seg>

<seg id="11"> So far in Europe, signs of the H5N1 virus have emerged in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Ukraine, and the European territory of Russia, among other places, almost all found on wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Romania discovered its 31st case on the 16th.  New cases were also found in Slovenia, Austria, Greece, and on the island of Ruegen in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In southern Italy, the bird flu virus was found on two ducks, the first creatures other than wild swans infected with the H5N1 virus in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> EU officials are now most worried about migratory birds which will soon return from Africa. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Nigerian government is stepping up efforts to prevent the virus on the African continent from spreading to humans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Nigerian government announced that poultry in a radius of five kilometers from affected farms, whether threatened by the virus or not, must be destroyed without exception. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The neighboring country of Niger declared a national alert and allocated 4 million US dollars to an emergency program to monitor the border with Nigeria. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 6 (Correspondents Han Jie and Xu Bo) On the 6th, reporters learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission that the Measures for Administration of E-banking Business and the Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking issued recently by the CBRC will take effect on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A CBRC spokesperson said that according to the rules of the Measures for Administration, relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged, that is, after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e-banking operations, if new types of e-banking operations need to be added, the main reporting office in China for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to standardize e-banking operations of commercial banks, the People's Bank of China promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of E-banking Business in June 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The CBRC spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e-banking operations, the Interim Measures can no longer meet the requirements of e-banking risk supervision.  Therefore, the CBRC formulated these two new rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the introduction by the CBRC spokesperson, CBRC accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises.  It is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e-banking security evaluation business, but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements, even if it does not have CBRC accreditation, financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e-banking security evaluation, though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Measures for Administration of E-banking Business include 99 articles under nine chapters, with the nine sections covering general provisions, applications and amendments, risk management, administration of data exchange and transfer, outsourcing business, administration of transnational business, supervision and management, legal obligations, and by-laws. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking includes 57 articles under five chapters, with the five sections covering general provisions, security evaluation institutions, implementation of security evaluations, administration of security evaluation activities, and by-laws. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Selected Excerpts from Newspapers and Magazines) Shanghai: Moonlighters and College Graduates Become Main Hourly Workforce </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 7   The Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th.  The number of job positions reached 120, 11 more than the previous time, while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to estimates by relevant experts at the Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau, currently the number of hourly workers in Shanghai has exceeded 1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a China Youth Daily report, the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters, accounting for 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In general, moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work.  For instance, among translation-related jobs, the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7%, while it has reached 61.6% for people in fitness professions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand.  Most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, a human resources manager in a company, spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field.  Of course, the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent, they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs.  Some 14% of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "At first I didn't want to be an hourly worker.  Yet after working for a few months, I feel it is better than working from 9 to 5." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Xiao Huang, whose job after college was not satisfying, eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am quite satisfied with my current job.  It pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too.  What I need to do now is find a few more hourly positions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job-seeking graduates to accumulate work experience, practice work skills, enhance communication skills, and increase exposure to society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge-based and more technically focused positions.  For instance, specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly jobs require few skills, such as food salespeople and inventory workers.  Laid-off workers can start work right after minimal training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Statistics show that among hourly workers, 39% were previously laid-off workers.  Among them, the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4%, while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7%.  Hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Anhui should grasp firmly the great opportunity to boost development in the central region, to adhere persistently and unswervingly to the central focus of economic construction, to earnestly implement the Central Committee guidelines and policies in close connection with the actual conditions of Anhui, to innovatively carry out work, and to apply scientific development viewpoints to specific measures and implement them in actual work. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It should summarize actual experiences in a timely way, rely fully on the masses, and vigorously support reforms and innovations so as to continuously open up new prospects for work in Anhui. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Wu Bangguo stressed that China has arrived at a historic phase in which we must rely more on increasing independent creativity and enhancing the quality of the workforce to push forward social and economic development, and that only through vigorously promoting scientific advancement and innovation can we realize the qualitative enhancement of production forces and effectively push economic and social development into the trajectory of scientific development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We should establish and perfect as soon as possible a systematic mechanism conducive to innovation, increase scientific and technological input, encourage patented inventions, develop famous brand-names, accelerate the transformation of scientific research achievements into actual productivity, reinforce the dominant position of companies in independent innovation, and continuously increase the contribution rate of scientific and technological advancements to economic growth. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We should support and encourage the inclusion of technical elements in distribution, establish and perfect a statistical index system that reflects independent innovation capabilities, study and formulate finance, tax, and government procurement policies that support independent innovation, and form a political system that encourages independent innovation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We should foster social consciousness toward innovation, vigorously advocate a brave innovative and competitive spirit, and focus on creating a good environment for people of talent to come forth in large numbers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Wu Bangguo noted that the NPC is playing an increasingly large role in pushing forth governance of the State by law and construction of a socialist country by the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to carry out NPC work under new situations, first, we should adhere to the correct political direction, resolutely stay on the road of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, and organically integrate adherence to the Party leadership, the status of people as masters, and the governance of the State by law. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Second, in initiating work, we should closely embrace the overall plan of the Party and the State, closely embrace the major issues of reform, development, and stability, and closely embrace hot and tough issues that are of general concern to the people, so as to continuously enhance the actual effects of NPC work. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Third, we should put forth the special features and advantages of NPC work, adhere to centralized democracy, carry out tasks in strict accordance with laws and procedures, and decide on issues collectively. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We should adhere to the line of the masses, be people-oriented, empower the people, empathize with the people, and work for the well-being of the people. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Experts: US Playing up "China Military Threat" is Groundless Accusation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 9 (Correspondents Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review that the US Pentagon has officially submitted to Congress recently, China was for the first time called "an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts think this is a groundless accusation against China's normal national defense construction.  It plays up "China military threat" and interferes in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guideline document. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The 92-page-long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on China's military issues and the countermeasures the United States should take.  Directly mentioning the two phrases of "China" or "Chinese" 15 times, the report said that "as a major and emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States.  If the United States does not have countermeasures, China will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy US advantages in conventional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences, said that though senior US officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier, this is the first time the United States proposed in its "national defense strategy report" that "China is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "The report for the first time explicitly refers to Russia, India and China as emerging strategic rivals; in particular, more attention was given to the so-called 'China military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow with the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Noticeably, on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress, with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the additional budget for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the US national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars, an all time high," Peng Guangqian said. "That is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guanqian thinks that the fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflected the Pentagon's habitual style of "making enemies" and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge US arms industry groups can fish for more profits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the United States, China's national defense expenditures are quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on China's national defense, said that China's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s, but the proportion it takes in the State national budget for the same period is on the decline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official statistics show that compared with 1979, the proportion of China's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the State budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005 China's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion RMB, only about 1/14 of that of the United States.  Its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the United States, and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a US soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The United States is equal to China in terms of territorial area, but there is such a big difference in military expenditures.  It is self-evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, director of the research department of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said that the United States should evaluate China's military construction situation objectively and that China's peaceful development doesn't necessarily mean that China and the United States will become military antagonists in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> China's 2004 white paper on national defense says that China firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China has never threatened any country in the past and at present, and will never do so in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> So far China has not set up any military base in any other country, nor has China dispatched a single soldier to other countries.  In contrast, the United States has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in Asia alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Zhu Feng, a professor of the International Relations Institute of Peking University, said that China and the United States should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the China-US constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Ram Allah, Feb. 9 (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency Correspondents Wang Hao and Huang Min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) won the Legislative Council elections, how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What new policies Hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the meantime, resistance by the US and Israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the Hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, various parties in Palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (Subtitle) Who Will Become Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between "Prime Minister Hamas" and current top leader Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that the new Palestinian government led and formed by Hamas will not recognize Israel.  This strong message also increased international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The US and Israel explicitly said that they would not accept a Hamas government which possesses actual power, threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this did not hinder Hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment, selecting an independent individual as a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, in order to obtain maximum international recognition, Hamas leaders both at home and abroad, who recently gathered in Egypt, decided to select independent Jamal al-Khudairi, board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza, as new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestinian analyst Hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister, the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard-line stance of Hamas.  Only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Subtitle) How to Divide Power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Internally, the biggest challenge Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An article carried in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam analyzed that although Hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs, it lacks experience in governance.  It would be wise for it to cooperate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience in governance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Following the elections, Hamas proposed establishing a "political partnership" with Fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government.  However, Fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet.  One faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move, while another faction rejects the Hamas invitation, preferring to be an "active opposition" in the Legislative Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Sources noted that under Abbas's persuasion, Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In spite of this, Hamas and Fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In addition, another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the Legislative Council, breaking away from partisan affiliations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts, but the specific name list is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Based on US and Israeli attitudes, forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to the provisions of the Palestinian Basic Law, after the new Legislative Council assumes power on the 16th of this month, the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Subtitle) What About Arms? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The weapons it possesses is another tough issue Hamas faces in forming the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The US and Israel are very firm in their positions, resolutely demanding that Hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The issue of weapons actually exists on two levels, the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the Legislative Council through democratic and free methods.  The way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction Az A-Din Al-Qassam Brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a "People's Army" of the Palestinian National Authority, yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (Jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At present, Palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel, most of whom come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions, such as al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the Fatah Hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must reach a consensus with Abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to local media reports, Abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces, while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the Interior Ministry of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue, with no outcome so far. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 10 (Correspondent Li Jianmin)  The State Oceanic Administration has recently released the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration.  This is the first time such reports have ever been released since China began its scientific polar expedition activities more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Report gives a comprehensive account of China's polar exploration activities, polar logistics assurance, and major progresses and achievements made in polar scientific research in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the records of the Report, at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing time), the Chinese Antarctic Inland Icecap Expedition team successfully reached Dome A area, the highest elevation of the Antarctic Inland Icecap, and at 3:15 on January. 18, 2005 (Beijing time) confirmed the highest elevation point of Dome A was 4,093 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the stage of increasingly competitive international polar expedition, the Chinese, relying on their strong willpower and fearless spirit, were courageous to open up new fields and took the lead to challenge the 'peak of the Antarctic Icecap.'  Their single-stroke success realized another dream of human beings in Antarctica." </seg>
<seg id="6"> SOA Director Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Report shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic expedition team successfully finished its mission and returned to Shanghai.  The expedition lasted 151 days on a journey of 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic expedition team left Shanghai for the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific exploration, and it will leave the Zhongshan Station for Shanghai by way of Australia before the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since it was the first report on polar exploration China released, the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration also reviewed and summarized China's polar exploration that started in the early 1980s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the Report, in 1983, China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty and became a member country of the organization.  In addition, China successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on Antarctic affairs, including the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Report noted that after more than 20 years, China's polar exploration "has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale," forming a "three stations, one vessel" system on Antarctica and Arctic exploration, namely, the Changcheng Station in the Antarctic established in February 1985 and the Zhongshan Station in the Antarctic established in February 1989, and the Huanghe Station built in July 2004 in the Arctic, as well as the "Xuelong" polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for Antarctic and Arctic exploration since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The statistics in the Report show that by the end of 2005, China had organized 22 Antarctic expeditions, two Arctic expeditions based on the "Xuelong" vessel, and another two Arctic expeditions at the Huanghe Station.  To date, more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by Chinese people nationwide to the Antarctica and Arctic for up close and on-site exploration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third Antarctica scientific station and also China's first inland station at the Antarctic." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After more than 20 years' endeavors, China has got a niche in polar exploration in the world.  However, compared with other major polar exploration countries, there is still a relatively large gap.  We must catch up with them." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Yongon, Feb. 12 (Correspondent Zhang Yunfei) In a special interview with reporters of this agency on the eve of Myanmar Prime Minister Soe Win's visit to China on the 14th, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Guan Mu and Commercial Attache Tang Hai said that at present China-Myanmar economic and trade Relations have showed positive momentum of common development featuring rich content, a great variety of forms, and mutual benefit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Ambassador Guan Mu said that in recent years the neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been solidified and developed.  Exchange and cooperation in various fields are increasingly expanding and deepening while bilateral economic and trade relations continue to be promoted and strengthened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Attache Tang Hai said that continued reciprocal visits at high level of the two countries have vigorously promoted the development of the bilateral economic and trade cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="5"> During the bilateral high-level reciprocal visits in 2004, the two sides signed 33 economic and trade cooperation agreement documents.  Most of them are now being implemented and carried out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He said that it was 1.14 billion US dollars in 2004 and reached 1.209 billion US dollars in 2005.  Of the total, China's exports were 935 million US dollars, while its imports stood at 274 million US dollars. </seg>

The main projects China has been contracted to do in Myanmar include power stations, bridges, harbors, and factories (such as sugar plants, textile plants, cement plants, and paper pulp plants), etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As Chinese companies carry out their engineering projects in Myanmar, they have also stimulated the export of various sets of mechanical and electronics products by China.  Myanmar has become one of the major markets for China's equipment sets, and mechanical and electronics products. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to the statistics by China's Customs, in the recent five or six years, the export volume of mechanical and electronics products has accounted for some 45% of China's total exports to Myanmar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Attache Tang also said that Myanmar is rich in natural resources.  Chinese companies have already started to invest in resource development projects in Myanmar's oil, natural gas, nickel and copper mining, etc.  The potential for the development of China-Myanmar economic and trade cooperation is tremendous. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He hopes that Chinese companies will have a long-term vision, learn to avoid risks, and make careful decisions.  They should set up a good corporate image and win honor to their country by ensuring the quality and timely completion of their awarded contract projects. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Feb. 13 (Correspondent Qian Zheng) Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of bio-artificial kidney, which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but also the function of preserving useful substances.  In addition it is small in size and easy to transplant.  With further research, there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a recent Nikkei Business Daily report, the newly-developed bio-artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts, an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine, such as water and amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Both the "artificial nephron" and the "artificial renal tubule" are made of hollow fibers.  In addition, the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis-related amyloidosis, a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis, into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose, vitamins, and minerals the body needs. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In contrast, previous artificial kidneys, depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste, were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers tested the bio-artificial kidney transplant on goats, using a pig's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are presently developing a bio-artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Safe Power Production in China Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondent An Bei) A senior official from the State Electricity Regulatory Commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005, safe power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At the fifth (expanded) meeting of the National Commission for Safe Power Production held here, SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said that in 2005 China's power production safety was generally stable, while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished.  Active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters, and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured.  Accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year-on-year basis, and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly-built power generator units added in succession, safe power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Included in these challenges are: regional, seasonal, and periodic power shortages will continue to exist; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems, while at the same time, the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control, with the situation remaining grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform, many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge.  How to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With regard to power production safety work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation, this year the SERC will carry out revision and improvement of the Provisional Regulations on Investigation of Power Production Accidents that were issued.  Meanwhile, supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005, electricity consumption by all sectors in China reached 2,468.9 gigawatt-hours, up 13.45% year-on-year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand, and increasing problems with coal, electricity, and oil transportation, various power producers took effective measures, stepping up management of infrastructure.  In all of last year, throughout the country, no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 grid accidents, down 127 cases year-on-year, and 427 infrastructure accidents, down 132 cases year-on-year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondents Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin) Minister Plenipotentiary Vusi B. Koloane, charge d'affaires ad interim of the South African embassy in China, said in an exclusive Xinhua interview on the 13th that there are no "organized" crimes against Chinese citizens in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At the same time, he said that the South African government will try its best to "crack down on all forms of criminal activity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce to zero" the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in South Africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since 2006, four Chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in South Africa.  Chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In response to this, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has made representations to South Africa and also reminded Chinese citizens in South Africa to further step up vigilance, enhance unity and friendship among Chinese compatriots, and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi B. Koloane said: "We apologize for this and assure the Chinese people that the South African government is earnestly investigating every single case involving Chinese nationals." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully cracked the February 5 case in which Chen Jianqing, a Chinese woman from Fujian, China, was killed in South Africa.  A suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At present police are after another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, according to the disclosure by the South African embassy in China, the criminal involved in the shooting of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year has been arrested by South African police, with the property of the victim recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Speaking of the impact that these incidents of Chinese citizens being killed may have, Vusi B. Koloane thinks that the incidents "indeed" will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade, tourism, and other fields between the two countries, but the impact "should be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the briefing by Nyembezi, tourism attache of the South African embassy, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals going to South Africa in the first 15 days alone of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, according to the Chinese official statistics, South Africa continued to maintain its position as China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion US dollars, growing 23% year-on-year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, tourism professionals think that the serial killings of Chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> According to the statistics of South Africa's tourism bureau, the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331, a 14.9% year-on-year decrease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Currently, some 200,000 Chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor, high unemployment rate, rampant use of guns, and lack of death penalty in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As many Chinese nationals do not understand English and have cash with them or in their homes, they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 14 (Correspondent Meng Na) While answering foreign correspondents' questions at a press conference held by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th, Zheng Baigang, deputy director of the Ministry's supervision department, pointed out that the so-called "use of inappropriate methods to make criminal suspects confess" is absolutely prohibited in China. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition, preventing such problems from happening is a major focus of work for the supervision department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He also noted that some international organizations do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of the situation of law enforcement by Chinese police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The latest data provided by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th reveal that in 2002 and 2004 the Ministry of Public Security successively issued the Provisions on the Implementation of Detention Measures and Record-keeping by Public Security Organs and the Provisions on Application of Further Interrogation by Public Security Organs, which have more effectively ensured that grass-roots public security organs carry out detention and interrogation measures in accordance with applicable laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, in order to further push for the "three rectifications" (namely, rectify the extraction of confessions by torture, rectify the abuse of arms and police equipment, and rectify the abuse of coercive measures) police supervisory personnel of public security organs nationwide have been persistently making open and secret trips to grass-roots and frontline law enforcement units such as police stations, criminal police teams, police patrol teams, traffic police teams, venues under the surveillance of public security organs, as well as scenes of law enforcement, to observe components of law enforcement involving citizens' personal safety rights, to check for holes and remedy oversights, to give warnings and reminders, and to stop wrongdoings at the outset. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In order to prevent law enforcement problems where they originate, police supervisory departments have further broadened the scope of law enforcement supervision and stepped up supervision and inspection of components of law enforcement, such as the application of subpoena measures, inquiries and interrogations, 110 police call processing, statistics on case filings, disposal of assets involved in cases, security officers who ticket fines and penalties, and data recording of automobile thefts and robberies. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Peking University Sets Up Mourning Hall in Memory of Academician Wang Xuan </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Li Jiangtao) After a few days of intensive arrangements, a mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Memorial Hall at Peking University officially opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th.  As of the noon this day, hundreds of people have come to pay their respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Some time after 8:00 a.m., a long line of dozens of people formed outside the door before the opening time of the mourning hall. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Inside the mourning hall at PKU's Centennial Hall, this reporter saw a black banner hanging from the wall of the hall which read "Deep Condolences for Academician Wang Xuan." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Beneath the banner was a huge 10-plus square meter portrait of Wang Xuan.  Wearing a pair of glasses, he looked scholarly with a gentle smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The portrait was flanked by several cypress trees and dozens of wreaths. </seg>
<seg id="7"> One of the wreaths had this elegiac couplet: "Originated in the Qin, thriving in the Tang, a good foundation was laid in China; bidding farewell to lead type, ushering in electronic type, the modern Bi Sheng drew up the blueprint." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The mourning hall was ensconced in funereal music in a solemn and heavy atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among the mourners were leaders, teachers, and students from PKU as well as Wang Xuan's friends, colleagues, students, and neighbors.  In addition, many people not acquainted with him at all also made special effort to come. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some of them held fresh flowers in their arms, while some carried flower baskets.  All had small white flowers pinned on their chests.  Slowly they walked up to the portrait of academician Wang Xuan and bowed to express their condolences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many people could not hold back tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and a PKU alumnus, told reporters that more than ten years ago, when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation to provincial Party committee cadres. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Academician Wang Xuan set a very good example for us both in character and academic discipline.  He made great contributions to the country and society.  People will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Professor Jin Ruilin from PKU Law School was Wang Xuan's old friend and neighbor for more than four decades. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Just discharged from the hospital a few days ago, he insisted on coming to say farewell to his old friend today. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As he left a message in the remembrance book, Mr. Jin could not contain his sadness and wiped away flowing tears several times with tissues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told reporters that Professor Wang lived a very simple life.  "He was already a professor with high achievements when he lived in Tongfu Garden, but he stayed in a very small flat for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he moved into Chengze Garden and stayed in a unit of about 70 or 80 square meters for more than ten years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> When PKU assigned him to a large unit of over 140 square meters in the Academician Building in Lanqiying, he did not want it.  He did not take the high-rise unit provided at Fangzheng Building either." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin recalled with deep emotion that during Wang Xuan's visits abroad, he was given great offers to stay abroad, but he resolutely refused them all. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "At first he insisted on not applying for the title of academician.  It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan's repeated pleas that he filled out the form." </seg>
<seg id="22"> What also deeply touched Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan's attitude toward young people.  "He himself emphasized many times, what can be achieved by looking at myself now, not at myself, on the contrary, I should mentor young people." </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that Wang Xuan started to focus on mentoring young people when he was in his 50s.  He constantly stressed that he wanted to pave the way for young people and that he wanted to be their stepping stone. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "It is really not easy for a scientist with great accomplishments to do this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> This reporter learned from the PKU News Center that the mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan is open to the public for people of all walks of life to pay their respects from 9:00 a.m. to 16:00 every day, starting from 9:00 on the morning of February 15 through noon on the 19th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Known as "the modern Bi Sheng," Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University, vice chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and an academician of the Third World Academy of Sciences, passed away at 11:03 on February 13 after medical treatments failed at Union Hospital in Beijing.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondents Zhou Wei and Li Fei) At present, many websites rely on republishing large quantities of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their hit rates, but many are not authorized to do so and have not paid any fees.  In response to this, Wang Ziqiang, director of the copyright division of the National Copyright Administration, said at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council on the 15th that regarding the issue of paying for republishing works online, the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued by the State Council will provide the answers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the provisions of the current law, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, newspapers and magazines can use works already published in newspapers and magazines without the consent of authors while paying compensation.  The National Copyright Administration has specifically set forth the compensation standards for republishing by newspapers and magazines in accordance with the provisions of the law. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the provisions of the current law, newspaper and magazine publishers have this legal right while no such legal permission is given to the internet at this time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to the relevant legal interpretation given by the Supreme People's Court, the legal permission to republish given to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet, that is, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, small articles published in newspapers, magazines, and on the internet can be used online without permission while compensations are made. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, since the legal interpretation does not stipulate the compensation standards, in reality such works are used on the internet without being given any compensations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Whether the legal permission is applicable to these published short works used on the internet still needs to be confirmed legally." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether it will be included into the scope set forth by the law still needs to be confirmed by the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued this year." </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Song Shiyi) Sedov, an official from the Russian Defense Ministry's press service, said in his speech to the media on the 15th that the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force will not affect the peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops in the short term and that the Russian troops will continue to carry out their peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Kokoshin, chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma (lower house of the parliament), noted this day in his speech about the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force that the Georgian resolution will undermine stability in the region and adversely affect Russian-Georgian ties. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Zhou Liquan) After a massive fire disaster occurred in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, the accident investigation team ascertained 11 culprits, among whom, four people including Zhang Diankun, head of the hospital electrician team, and others will be indicted with charges of causing a major accident due to negligence. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the investigation, at about 16:30 on the day of the accident, there was a sudden power outage in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City.  According to the design of electrical circuit for the hospital, if there was a power outage, the switch of the transformer would be automatically switched to the secondary switch so as to continue providing normal power supply for the hospital.  However, the switch did not make the automatic switch at the time, yet the electrician team leader Zhang Diankun forced the power back on without checking the cause of the power outage, causing the fire disaster. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16  The Central Organization Department recently issued Suggestions for Strengthening Supervision of Cadres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Suggestions call on all levels of the Organization Department to supervise cadres in the various components of training, education, inspection, examination, selection, appointment, and day-to-day management, on the basis of strict administration and benevolent protection of cadres.  They should establish to perfection supervisory working mechanism that emphasizes prevention, timely detection, and serious rectification, so as to effectively strengthen supervision over selection and appointment of leading cadres and cadres overall. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With regard to supervision of leadership teams and leading cadres, the Suggestions propose that education on ideals and beliefs, as well as anti-corruption and promotion of integrity, should be persistently carried out.  Such education should be incorporated into the training, selection, management, and supervision of cadres so as to guide and urge leading cadres to enhance cultivation of Party spirit, adhere to the Party's principle of serving public interests and people's welfare, and build up a strong ideological line of defense against corruption and degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While talking with newly-promoted cadres about their appointments, the desire for integrity and self-discipline should be made clear. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Leadership teams at all levels should be urged to adhere to democratic centralism and to establish and perfect administrative and decision making rules and procedures, so as to earnestly implement a system of collective leadership combined with individual responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Emphasis should be placed on supervision of chief officials of leadership teams.  Organization (personnel) Department heads should have regular heart-to-heart talks with chief officials of subordinate leadership teams so as to learn about their ideologies, work, and styles, among other circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Establish to perfection a day-to-day supervisory system for leading cadres, periodically engage in learning and analysis about the circumstances of ideologies and styles of leading cadres, and propose problem-solving suggestions and measures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Implement a system of warning discussions and inquiry letters for leading cadres, and engage in timely warning discussions or letters of inquiry once signs of trouble are detected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Earnestly investigate prominent problems involving leading cadres reported by ordinary people.  If problems truly exist, criticism, education, or corresponding organizational disciplinary action should be carried out, depending on individual cases.  Violators of regulations and laws should be turned over to law enforcement organs.  If investigations confirm there have been problems, appropriate methods should be taken to clean things up. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, integrate strengthening supervision with encouraging cadres to engage in bold exploration and innovation, while paying attention to discovering and praising exemplary cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Suggestions call on the Organization (personnel) Department at all levels to effectively strengthen supervision of the selection and appointment of Party and government leading cadres. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Further improve supervisory measures concerning components of cadre work such as recommendations, examinations, consultations, discussions, and decisions.  Strictly safeguard the process of personnel selection and appointment, and provide firm assurance that cadres who are politically reliable, professionally competent, impeccable in style, and worthy of public trust are selected and appointed for leading positions at various levels. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Strengthen inspection of the implementation of the cadre appointment regulations, seriously investigate and punish violations of the cadre appointment regulations, and firmly prevent inappropriate practices and corruption involving personnel appointments. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Implement a case-based supervisory and investigative system regarding serious violations of personnel appointment regulations to expand supervision and punishment. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Establish and perfect a system of accountability regarding cadre selection and appointment.

<seg id="21"> The Organization (personnel) Department must strengthen cooperation with discipline inspection organs and establish a communication system, liaison system, and accountability system with discipline inspection organs regarding Party spirit and administrative integrity of cadres, so as to enhance collective supervision. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Earnestly and effectively conduct inspection tours in cooperation with discipline inspection organs, improve inspection tour methods, perfect the inspection tour system, and enhance the quality of inspection tours. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Chen Jianxing) On the 15th, Taiwan's official economic affairs department decided to fine United Microelectronics Corp. (abbreviated as UMC), one of Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, NT$ 5 million on the grounds of "illegally providing assistance to and participating in the establishment of" mainland-based Hejian Technology Company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case of Taiwan authorities fining a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian proposed a cross-Strait economic and trade policy advocating "active management and effective opening." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to reports, officials from the "MOEA Investment Commission" said  that UMC was fined because it violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the Regulations Governing the Approval of Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the future, the "MOEA Investment Commission" will also fine former UMC Chairman Tsao Hsing-cheng and others, depending on the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The UMC case originated in February 2005 when Taiwan's prosecution and investigation departments deployed nearly a hundred personnel in raids on the residences and offices of several top UMC officials, claiming that UMC was suspected of illegally "providing funds, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Technology, its mainland investment. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Tsao Hsing-cheng, UMC chairman at the time, subsequently stated publicly that UMC had not violated any regulations of Taiwan authorities and that UMC provided assistance to Hejian Technology in the long-term interest of UMC, since UMC would lose business opportunities if it did not get into the mainland market as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following that, Taiwan's official Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$ 3 million on the grounds of violating relevant regulations concerning business information disclosures. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the UMC Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Tsao Hsing-cheng, who a few hours later was officially indicted on suspected illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> UMC, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (abbreviated as TSMC) known as Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, is a leading high-tech corporation on the island. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The series of moves by Taiwan authorities to investigate and punish UMC over the past year have attracted great attention from all sectors of society on the island. </seg>

<seg id="1"> State Administration of Work Safety: Prevention of Frequent Serious and Large-scale Coalmine and Other Accidents is Top Priority This Year </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 17 (Correspondent Liu Zheng) With a series of four coalmine accidents each killing more than 100 people, the grim work safety situation throughout the country last year has made "prevention of frequent serous and large-scale coalmine and other accidents" the top priority of work safety efforts nationwide this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On the 17th, this reporter learned from SAWS that in order to truly prevent frequent serious and large-scale coalmine and other accidents, coalmines must be the top priority. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With regard to coalmine safety this year, SAWS will effectively carry out the following three tasks: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of controlling methane. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This year "ventilation first, mining second" will be featured in controlling methane. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If coal mines with high concentrations of methane do not implement "ventilation first, mining second," they will be ordered to immediately stop production in accordance with the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of restructuring and shutting down. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Resolutely and tightly shut down every one of the 5,243 coalmines which have been publicly announced and the other 700-plus coalmines widely reported recently. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consider shut-downs to be routine work and continuously shut down those coalmines that destroy natural resources, pollute the environment, and do not maintain safety measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Enhance basic coalmine safety administration. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Promptly rectify and halt administrative declines in a handful of large state-owned coalmines and guide small coalmines with chaotic management to set up standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In particular, emphasis should be placed on key state-owned coalmines, absolutely prohibiting production that exceeds capacity, exceeds the intensity threshold, and exceeds the established number of workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This year's work safety control targets call for a reduction of the nationwide death toll from various kinds of accidents by 3% from the previous year, with a reduction of 3.5% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths should be reduced by 5%, with a reduction of 7% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="16"> People's governments at the provincial level have all been informed of these control targets, which are being passed down to various levels for implementation at grassroots levels and in companies in all localities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that in 2005, 5,986 people died in coalmine accidents nationwide, down 0.7% year-on-year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths went up, with the death toll rising by 66.6% year-on-year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, Feb. 17 News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua Correspondents Gao Peng and Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the Turin Winter Olympics may face "prison sentences," based on various circumstances at this time, such fate is unlikely to happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, the center of the first stimulant scandal at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the 16th, the first stimulant scandal broke out at the Turin Winter Olympics when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedon, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics.  In addition, she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women's 15 km event she won at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the International Biathlon Union decided to give Pyleva a two-year ban from the competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has always been the IOC regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the Olympic Games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete, but they are not subject to legal sanctions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, under Italian law, athletes' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts.  Prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants, and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In December last year, after "bargaining" for a year, the IOC and the Italian government finally reached an agreement, under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this Winter Olympics in accordance with the Italian law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Through the untiring efforts of the IOC, the Italian side made concession four days before the Winter Olympics opened, promising that police would not enter the Olympic village to raid athletes' quarters during the Winter Olympics, but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of Italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some reports said that Pescante, an Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, has already turned over the case of Pyleva using stimulant to Turin's prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the IOC and Pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva has already left Turin for her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who formerly worked at the World Anti-Doping Agency for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns to her country, this incident may eventually "end where it is." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng said that the IOC and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympics.  Even if the Italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case, the outcome is still hard to tell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on Italy's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse, the maximum penalties violators got were only "two-year deferred imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Therefore, Piaili, a senior reporter from the Italian news agency ANSA, said that there is "little" chance that Pyleva will go to jail.  She would just face fines at maximum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Piaili also said that although the Italian court can hold a trial in absentia, the Italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch Pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, the Italian side will not be able to do anything to her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  Comprehensive reports by Xinhua correspondents abroad said that bird flu continues to spread further on the African continent. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The WHO confirmed on the 17th that birds that died from infection with bird flu virus have been found in three areas in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, the H5 strain of bird flu virus has also been discovered for the first time in France.  Europe and Africa are on high alert and stepping up epidemic prevention measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Advisor Hassan Bushra told the news media in Egypt on the 17th that dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been found in three areas of Cairo and Giza in central Egypt, and Minya in the south.  Relevant departments of the Egyptian government have already started to slaughter fowls that are suspected of being infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts noted that as Egypt is an important passageway for migratory birds in the Middle East and North Africa, it is highly likely that migratory birds may bring the bird flu virus to the country. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on the import of live poultry from abroad and stepped up inspection and quarantine practices at the ports of entry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, more than 800 chickens on a chicken farm died mysteriously in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend the import of all poultry and pork from Nigeria, where a bird flu epidemic occurred, and put a temporary stop on the trade of poultry and related products on all markets along the border between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the government of Cameroon has promptly set up an epidemic monitoring network across the country.  The Pasteur Centre in the country and the State Veterinary Laboratory are on high alert, ready to carry out testing related to the H5N1 virus at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the epidemic on the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The National Veterinary Institute in Sweden released the test results of the dead swans discovered Wednesday, which showed the Swedish swans were not infected with bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The preliminary results of tests by the Danish Veterinary Administration also show that the thirty dead swans recently found within Denmark were not infected with bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However, the agriculture department said that Denmark still cannot afford to be off guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Since this year, nine outbreaks of bird flu have occurred in Romania in eastern Europe.  WHO experts said in Bucharest on the 17th that since bird flu broke out in almost all places in the Danube Delta region, the situation must be addressed seriously as Romania may be constantly threatened by bird flu in the next three or five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the Asian country of Bangladesh, the government has taken all necessary preventive measures against bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided relevant books on bird flu prevention to relevant officials and organized domestic fowl breeders for training. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  According to a disclosure by the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province, China's first blood information and data sharing administration and control network system was officially completed and put into operation at the center recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A relevant administrator at the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said this means that from now on, citizens will be given a unique code after participating in a blood drive with any county (city or district) blood collection/supply agency in Zhejiang Province.  The next time he/she donates blood, just by inputting the relevant code, information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation history, time of the last blood donation, and whether blood can be donated this time will be instantly displayed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The administrator further explained that if, after inputting the code, the system shows an inadequate lapse of time between blood donations, the system will indicate that conditions for blood donation this time have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This way not only protects blood donors' health but also more effectively protects blood users' health and safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In addition, when blood supplies are tight, priority will be given to blood donors and their families for the use of blood.  You just have to input the valid blood donor certificate, and information about the blood donor will instantly appear.  It is extremely convenient. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe and send people into panic. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Executive Committee of the European Union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional "buffer area" controls, including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control, and forbidding all trade and transportation of poultries and bird species. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The bird flu breakouts continue to spread to more chicken farms following the eighth day since the deadly H5N1 virus was discovered in Nigeria, Africa, and tracks demonstrate that it has crossed the northern border of Nigeria and entered into Niger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Egyptian officials are investigating the sudden mass death of chickens on a chicken farm in the south, and there is concern that the virus might continue to spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Chicken meat markets in Europe are falling to a great extent because of the impact of the virus event. The Executive Committee of the European Union stressed that there is no reason to panic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Jipu Ruinuo, an executive member of the committee responsible for sanitation and food safety, said that it is understandable for people to be concerned about the event but there is no need for overreaction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Executive Committee of the European Union has issued a new regulation and listed all of the European areas where the virus has been discovered as "buffer areas" after passing a previous resolution about the establishment of a three-kilometer protection area and ten-kilometer warning area around every virus discovery spot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> An official for the European Union, who preferred to remain anonymous, pointed out that everyone is very nervous, and processing news from everywhere in Europe about suspicions of breakouts of the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Until now, the H5N1 virus has been discovered in European regions including Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Ukraine, and Russia, and has been discovered almost exclusively in groups of wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the 16th, Romania discovered its 31st epidemic case, and Slovenia, Austria, Greece, and Ruegen Island in Germany have also discovered new epidemic cases. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The bird flu virus was discovered in the bodies of two ducks in southern Italy, which are the first poultry infected with the H5N1 virus in the European region, aside from wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The greatest concern that European Union officials have is those migrant birds that will be flying back from Africa. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Nigerian government is strengthening its work to prevent the human infection of the virus on the African continent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Nigerian government announced that all poultries and bird species must be destroyed within a five-kilometer area of where an infected farm is discovered, regardless of whether they are threatened by the virus or not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The government of Niger, its neighbor country, has announced a national warning state, and made an emergency plan by providing 4 million USD to monitor the border areas with Nigeria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The newly established National Emergency Committee stated that they have received a report that nearly 400 poultries and bird species are dead in Magaria, a loosely guarded area between the two countries. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's New Electronic Banking Business Management Regulations will be Implemented on March 1 </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6 (reporter: Han Jie and Xu Bo) Reporters learned from China's Banking Supervision Committee on the 6th that the "Electronic Banking Business Management Method" and the "Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment" issued by the Banking Supervision Committee in recent days will be implemented on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that based on the management method regulations, the approval method for foreign financial institutions is unchanged, i.e. if a branch of a foreign bank is approved to establish an online banking business and it needs to add a new service item for the online banking business, the major unit that reports to the branch in China's territory should be solely responsible for the application and review. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To normalize banking business development of commercial banks that use the Internet, the Chinese People's Bank has made and issued the "Temporary Method for Management of Online Banking Businesses" in June, 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that with the continuous development of electronic banking business at commercial banks, the Temporary Method cannot meet the requirements for electronic banking risk control anymore. Thus, the Banking Supervision Committee has made two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As the spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee introduced, the acknowledgement of the Banking Supervision Committee on qualification of a security assessment setup is different from industrial admission or administrative approval for admission qualification for enterprises, and it is not a necessary condition for an assessment setup to conduct its security assessment business for electronic banking, and it is only a reference when financial institutions select an assessment setup. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as a security assessment setup follows related conditions and requirements, even if it is not acknowledged by the Banking Supervision Committee for its qualification, financial institutions can still invite it to conduct an assessment for electronic banking security, but it should be controlled according to related regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The "Method for Management of Electronic Banking Businesses" has a total of nine chapters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts, including the General Principle, Application and Renewal, Risk Control, Data Exchange and Transfer Control, Business Contract Control, Cross-Border Business Activities Control, Supervision Control, Liabilities, and Additional Regulations, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The "Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment" has a total of five chapters and 57 articles that are divided into five parts, including the General Principle, Security Assessment Setup, Implementation of Security Assessment, Management of Security Assessment Activities, and Additional Regulations, etc. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, February 6 (reporter: Chen Ming) Lin Yixing, an overseas Chinese from Fuqing, Fujian Province, China, was wounded when he was running his bar, and was robbed by local gunmen in the early morning of February 5, South African local time. He died after unsuccessful emergency treatment at a hospital in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa, in the early morning of the 6th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As Feng Yang, the President of the Overseas Chinese Association of Freedom State Province, said, the incident occurred at a bar in Welkom, more that 130 kilometers northwest of Bloemfontein. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While Lin Yixing, the bar owner, was cleaning items under the bar counter and preparing to end that day's business, </seg>
<seg id="5"> there were still three customers at the bar at that time. One of them pulled out a pistol and rushed behind the bar to rob him. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Lin Yixing, who was more than 40 years old, wrestled with those robbers. They shot Ling Yixing one time, and then fled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Locals rushed to the scene after they heard the news, and sent Lin Yixing to the hospital for emergency treatment. Since Lin Yixing's body had "symptoms of diffuse capillary bleeding," and the bleeding could not be stopped, Lin died around 3:30 a.m. in the early morning of February 6. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Newspaper Digest) Part-Time Workers and High School Graduates Become Major Forces of Hourly-Paid Work in Shanghai </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7. The "Guidance on the Current Standard for Hourly-Paid Wages in 2006" issued by the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City on February 6, lists 120 occupations, which is 11 more than the number issued last time. The "wage levels" of the original positions are either increased or reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As an estimate made by related experts of the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City, currently the hourly-paid workers in Shanghai are more than one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As China Youth Journal reported, part-time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of hourly-paid labors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Through a direct survey of more than 8,000 hourly-paid workers, more than half of them are part-time workers, and their ratio is 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Those part-time workers are generally well educated, and mainly do more technical work. For instance, the ratio of part-time workers in the translation occupation is as high as 81.7%, and that in the gym business is 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at hourly-paid part-time jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As was learned, monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of Yuan, and it is difficult to find high-demand talents, such as simultaneous interpreters; most hourly-paid workers' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 Yuan, such as part-time financial workers, wedding ceremony managers, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> One of the important reasons for the popularity of part-time workers for hourly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For instance, Mr. Gu, who is a manager of the Human Resources Unit at a company, uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu thinks that the greatest benefit of a part-time job is to continuously renew his own knowledge, and has opportunities to know another field, and of course, a monthly income of 2,000 Yuan is also attractive to a certain extent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since some positions for hourly-paid workers are low-skill ones, and their working patterns are flexible and free, they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs. 14% of hourly-paid workers are graduates from colleges and polytechnic schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "I did not want to do an hourly-paid job in the beginning. But several months later, I feel it is better than 9 to 5 work." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Xiao Huang's job hunting is not that satisfying after he graduates from college. He eventually registers with a hotel and plays background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am quite satisfied with my current work, 100 yuan per hour, and the environment is also good. What I should do now is to find several more hourly-paid jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As has been learned, hourly-paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumulate work experience, exercise their work skills, improve their communication skills, and enrich their social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Those graduates who work at hourly-paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills, including translation positions, which require professional skills, and entertainment and performance positions, which require current popularity. These two kinds of positions are 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively, among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some positions for hourly-paid workers do not require high skills, such as food promotion workers, merchandise handlers, and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple trainings. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Data shows that those hourly-paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39% of the total hourly-paid workers; among them, workers who used to work in retail business are 68.4%; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 58.7%. The hourly-paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Wu Bangguo pointed out that the People's Congress is playing more important roles in the process of administration of the nation with laws and construction of the socialist country with legal systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For the People's Congress to do a good job in the new situation, the first thing should be to stick to a correct political direction, firmly walk on the developmental path of socialist politics with Chinese features, and organically integrate staying with the leadership of the Party, people being in charge, and governing the country according to laws. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The second thing should be to focus on the major work of the party and state, important issues in reforms and developments, and working on hot and difficult issues that the masses of people care about, and continuously strengthen the efficiency of the work of the People's Congress. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Comes Up With an "Important Science and Research Plan" for Future 15 Years </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (reporter: Li Xing) To promote China's international competitive capacity, vigorously advance sustainable development, and realize a prioritized plan for surpassing (developed countries), the "Outline Plan for the State's Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development (2006 to 2020)," issued by the State Council on the 9th, has arranged four important plans for scientific studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The four important scientific plans include protein studies, quantum adjustment and control studies, nano-studies, and growth and reproduction studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The outline points out that protein science is the peak of life science that developed countries are fiercely competing for. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China should focus on studying transcription repression histochemistry, protein histochemistry, metabolic histochemistry, structural biology, functions and interactions of protein biology, biology and systematic biology regarding protein calculation, methodology of protein studies and related application and basic studies, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the outline thinks that quantum adjustment and control studies has an obvious forward-looking nature, and might significantly impact the economic development of human society to an extent that can hardly be assessed in 20 to 30 years. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China should focus on studying the carrier, adjustment, and control rationales and methods of quantum communication, quantum calculation, the new quantum effect of constrained small quantum systems, quantum adjustment and control demonstration, and a new rationale and technical basis for quantum measurement, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Experts: "China's Military Threat" Touted by the United States Is an Unreasonable Accusation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (reporters: Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, Lin Liping). The Quadrennial Defense Review formally submitted by the United States Pentagon to the Congress a few days ago first calls China "a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the United States militarily." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against China's normal defense construction, and an interference in China's internal affairs by exaggerating the "theory of China's military threat." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is a new guidance document for national defense of the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This 92-page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of China's military strength and how the United States should cope with it. The report directly mentions the two terms of "China" and "Chinese" 15 times, and says that, "As a major newly arisen power, China has the most military potential to compete with the United States; if the United States does not take any countermeasures, China is very likely to develop destructive military technology, and break the US supremacy of traditional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow at the World's Military Study Office of China's Military Science Academy, said that although senior US officials expressed similar views before, this is the first time for the United States to come up with the idea that "China is most likely to challenge the United States militarily as a newly arisen power" in a Defense Strategy Report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "This report first regards Russia, India, and China as newly arisen strategic rivals, and especially, pays more attention to the so-called 'theory of China's military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow at China's Military Science Academy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The noticeable thing is that on the same day when The Quadrennial Defense Review was submitted, US President Bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the Congress, and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the budget for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the defense budget for the US in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars," said Peng Guangqian. "And this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian thinks that the US method of making "theories of threats from other countries" reflects its consistent style of "making enemies," and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the US's gigantic defense industry groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the US, China's military expenditure is quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated in the writing of the China Defense White Paper many times, said that since the 90s of the 20th century, with the economic development, China's defense funding has been increased to some extent, but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state's financial expenditure in the same periods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979, the ratio of China's defense expenditure in the state's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> China's defense funding in 2005 was RMB 244.656 billion Yuan, which only amounts to 1/14 of that of the US; military expense per capita is only equal to 1/60 of that of the US; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1/30 of that of the US Armed Forces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The US land area is about as big as China's, but the gap in military expenditures between (the two countries) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> said Peng Guangqian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, Director of the Study Office at China's Armament Control and Disarmament Association, said that the US side should objectively comment on China's military construction, and China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the United States will become military rivals in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> China's Defense White Paper 2004 says that China firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> China has never established any military bases in any other countries so far, nor sent any troops to other countries; but the United States has established more than a hundred overseas military bases, and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the Asian region alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Zhu Feng, a professor at the International Relations College of Beijing University, said that both China and the United States should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust, thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between China and the United States in the new century, and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Organization of its Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Ramallah, February 9 (International Observation). Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Organization of its Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency reporters: Wang Hao and Huang Min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the Legislative Committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kind of a new policy Hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the boycott attitude of the United States and Israel has made the prospect of the Hamas government more uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently, all the parties in Palestine are consulting each other tensely, and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subtitle) Who Will be Selected to Take the Position of Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Some outsiders worry that a "Hamas Prime Minister" might have disagreements with Abbas, the current supreme leader, after Hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Moreover, a Hamas leader, Mushir, who is visiting Egypt, stressed that a new Palestinian government established by Hamas leadership will not acknowledge Israel. This strong signal has also raised more international concerns. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The United States and Israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a Hamas government that controls real power, and threatened to stop their economic aid to Palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the Palestinian side. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, these things do not hinder Hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly. Selection of an independent candidate is one compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As it has been reported, to win maximum acknowledgement internationally, the Hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in Egypt a few days ago, had decided to select Jamal al-Khudairi, an independent person who is the Chair of the Board of Gaza Islamic University, to be the new Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This move has not been responded to by related parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Hussein, a Palestinian analyst, said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister, the most important thing is to soften the "strong" attitude of Hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister, and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Subtitle) How to Allocate Power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The biggest challenge for Hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An article published by the Palestinian Daily Journal analyzed that although Hamas has won support from people through social welfare items, it lacks administrative experience, and a better strategy is to collaborate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has administrative experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hamas suggested to establish a "political partnership" with Fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election, but Fatah has not actively responded to it so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Inside Fatah, there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it; some refuse the invitation from Hamas and would rather become an "active opposition" in the Legislative Committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A well-informed source pointed out that Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after Abbas's persuasion. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even so, Fatah will bargain with Hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the Legislative Committee and free of partisan leanings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As it has been reported, Hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government, but the concrete name list of the government is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Because of the attitude of the United States and Israel, a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to regulations of the Palestinian "Essential Law," nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new Legislative Committee assumes office on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Subtitle) Where does the Armed Wing go? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The attitude of the United States and Israel is very strong, and they firmly request that Hamas give up violence, and refuse its joining the government with its weapons. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mushir stressed on the 9th that the armed resistance is the "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the Legislative Committee through a democratic and free method, and the legitimatized path for its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, is to integrate it into a security organization for the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a "People's Army" under the Palestinian National Authority, but it has not received broad responses, and has even been criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Organization (Jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations, and most of them come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Moreover, Fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them, such as the "Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades" and "Fatah Hawks," etc. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, responsible for the cabinet organization, must make an agreement with Abbas on how to control those self-governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As local media reported, Abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the Internal Affairs Ministry of a new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue, and have not produced any results. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10 (reporter: Li Jianmin). The China's Polar-Region Exploration Report 2005 issued by the State Ocean Bureau of China is the first published one since China started its polar region scientific exploration activities more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The report thoroughly reflects the major developments and accomplishments of China's scientific exploration activities, exploration logistic support, and scientific studies in the polar regions in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Based on the record of the report, China's Antarctic Inland Ice Cover Exploration Team successfully climbed to the A area of the peak of the ice mountain where the top of the inland ice cover at the South Pole was above sea level at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing Time), and determined that the highest spot of Ice Mountain A was 4,093 meters at 3:15 on January 18 (Beijing Time). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the stage of international polar-region exploration, where competition is becoming increasingly fierce, the Chinese resort to their strong will and fearless spirit, bravely exploring the new field and successfully first climbing the 'highest point of ice cover at the South Pole' with one move, and making one more dream of mankind come true at the South Pole." </seg>
<seg id="6"> Sun Zhihui, the head of the State Ocean Bureau, said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report demonstrates that the 21st Antarctic Exploration Team of China accomplished its tasks completely and returned to Shanghai on March 24, 2005. The exploration lasted 151 days, and its total voyage was 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd South Pole Exploration Team left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station at the South Pole to conduct scientific exploration activities, and would leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai through Australia before the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since it is the first time for China to issue the polar-region exploration report, China's Polar-Region Exploration Report 2005 also traces back and summarizes China's polar-region exploration efforts, which started in the 80s of the 20th century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the report, China formally joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983, and became a member country of the Antarctic Treaty, and a consulting member country of the Antarctic Treaty, and a member country of those most influential international organizations of South Pole affairs, respectively, including the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Antarctic Bureau President Council. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee, and won its speaking right and decision-making right in international polar-region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The report points out that in more than 20 years, China's polar-region explorations have been developed from nothing to having something, and advanced continuously into an initial size. A scientific and exploration system for the South and North Poles, including "three stations and one ship," has been formed, i.e. the Antarctic Great Wall Station established in February 1985; Zhongshan Antarctic Station established in February 1989; the Arctic Huanghe Station established in July 2004, and the "Snow Dragon" polar-region exploration ship that has assumed exploration tasks in the Antarctic and Arctic since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Based on the statistics in the report, China has organized 22 scientific explorations, 2 scientific explorations in the Arctic by using the "Snow Dragon" ship as a carrier platform in the Arctic, and 2 batches of explorations around the Arctic Huanghe Station by the end of 2005. There have been more than 3,000 person times of team members nationwide so far who have been in the Antarctic or Arctic to do field explorations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "Currently, we are doing investigation work for the feasibility of building the third exploration station in the Antarctic, that is also China's first inland exploration station in the Antarctic," </seg>
<seg id="15"> said Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Through more than 20 years' efforts, China's polar-region exploration cause has played a role in the world's polar-region explorations. But compared with those major countries of polar-region explorations, there is still a bigger gap (between China and them), and we must catch up with them," </seg>
<seg id="17"> he said. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 13 (reporter: Qian Zheng). Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of manmade biological kidney that can not only function the same as a human kidney for catabolism, but can also keep useful substances in the body. Since it is small in size and easy to transplant, it is hopeful that it will bring good news to patients who have kidney disease with the further development of the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As Japan Economic and Industrial News reported a few days ago, the newly developed manmade biological kidney is composed of two parts. One is the "manmade nephron," which filters metabolites and water in the blood; the other is the "manmade urinary tubules," which extract useful substances such as water and amino acids from the original urine and sends them back into the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Both the "manmade nephron" and "manmade urinary tubules" are made of hollow threads, and the internal walls of the "manmade urinary tubules" are paved with epithelial cells of urinary tubules that have the function of catabolism. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This type of epithelial cells can treat diseases caused by repeated hemodialysis and decompose the causative substance of "dialysis-related denatured starch" into an amino acid, and send it back into the blood. They can also send those substances necessary for the human body such as glucose, vitamins, and minerals back into the blood again. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Previous manmade kidneys depended on the osmosis pressure gap of dialysis to filter metabolites, which cannot totally get rid of them, and does not have the function of making amino acids and other substances return into the blood. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers used goats to do the manmade kidney transplant experiment, and the inner walls of hollow threads of the manmade kidney are lined with epithelial cells from a hog. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Secure Power Production Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13 (reporter: An Pei). A leader of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee said on the 13th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005, secure power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Vice Chairman of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee Shi Yubo said at the Fifth (expanded) Session of the National Secure Power Production Committee that in 2005 China's secure power production was stable in general, and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the summertime, realized a secure power supply, actively coped with the strikes of natural disasters, and basically assured the secure and stable operation of power systems, greatly reduced equipment accidents in secure power production and general power network accidents, compared with those of last year, and the health level of power equipment was increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations, and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another, secure power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include: regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortages still exist; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed, supply of power and coal is still quite problematic; at the same time, the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled, and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets; some power network structures are fragile and their equipment is obsolete, which brings risks to systems' safety; frequent occurrences of accidents in power infrastructure construction have not completely changed, and the situation is still serious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the further development of power system reform, many deep-rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed, and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the secure power production work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perfected to strengthen responsive capabilities for emergencies; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened; security of big dams should be assured; safety control of power facility constructions should be strengthened to reduce occurrences of personnel injury and death accidents; information delivery work should be continuously strengthened to assure the accurate, timely, and smooth flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation, this year the Power Supervision and Control Committee will revise and perfect the issued Temporary Regulations on Accident Investigation of Power Production, and at the same time will continuously issue and execute additional documents about the safety of the hydraulic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005, the whole of Chinese society used a total power of 2468.9 billion KWh, and increased 13.45% compared with that of last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Facing the situation in which power supply and demand is still tense, and the unfavorable status of transportation problems with coal, power, and oil, power enterprises have taken effective measures and strengthened equipment control, and prevented the occurrence of large equipment accidents in national power production in all of last year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 power network accidents, which were reduced by 127 compared with those of last year; equipment accidents were 427, which were reduced by 132 compared with those of last year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Minister of South Africa, in China, Says There Are No "Organized" Criminal Activities against Chinese Citizens in South Africa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13 (reporters: Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin). Charge d'Affaires ad interim and Minister of the South African Embassy in China Vusi Bruce Koloane said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 13th that there are no "organized" criminal activities against Chinese citizens in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said at the same time that the South African government will make every effort to "strike against all forms of criminal activities." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi Bruce Koloane stated that the South African government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero," and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in South Africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since 2006, 4 Chinese citizens have been killed, one after another, in South Africa, and the Chinese world has broadly paid attention to it. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Foreign Ministry has contacted the South African side about the matter, and warned Chinese citizens who are traveling in South Africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection, and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas Chinese, and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi Bruce Koloane said, "We are sorry for this, and we also want the Chinese people to believe that the South African government is carefully investigating every case related to the Chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As the embassy of South Africa presented, the South African police have successfully broken a case in which Chen Jianqing, a woman came from Fujian, China, was killed on February 5 in South Africa, and have arrested a suspect. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The police are searching for another suspect at present. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As the South African embassy in China disclosed, the suspect, who is charged with the gun death of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year, has been arrested by the South African police, and the belongings of the victim have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> When talking about the possible impacts of the killings of Chinese citizens, Vusi Bruce Koloane thinks that those incidents will "indeed" impact trade, tourism, and exchanges in other fields between the two countries, and produce negative outcomes. But in the long run, those impacts "should not be big." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As Tourist Attache of the South African embassy Nian Beixi presented, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for Chinese to go to South Africa in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Based on the statistical data of the Chinese government, South Africa had maintained its number one status as China's biggest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion USD, and increased 23% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing Chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Based on the statistics of the Sightseeing Bureau of South Africa, there were 20,331 Chinese tourists who visited South Africa in the first half of 2005, which were reduced 14.9% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> There are about 200,000 Chinese who live in South Africa at present, and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in South African society, and a high unemployment rate, guns are spread everywhere, and no death penalty, the crime rate is still high there. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not speak English, and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes, they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (reporter: Li Jiangtao). Through several days of tense arrangements, the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan that was set up at the Memorial of the Hundred-Year Anniversary of Peking University was formally opened at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 15th. By noon of that day, several hundred people had come and offered their condolences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Before the mourning hall's opening time, about 8 a.m. that morning, several dozen people had waited in a long line outside the hall's gate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Inside the memorial hall, the reporter saw the dark, horizontal banner with the calligraphy "Express Profound Condolences over Academician Wang Xuan" hanging on the wall of the Memorial of the Hundred-Year Anniversary of Peking University. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner, there was a big picture of Wang Xuan that was more than ten square meters in size. Wang was wearing a pair of glasses, smiling with a scholarly air. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Several cypress trees and several dozen wreaths were put along both sides of the picture. </seg>
<seg id="7"> An elegiac couplet on a wreath was written like this: "It began in the Qin Dynasty, prospered in the Tang Dynasty, glorified China, and skillfully laid a foundation; the contemporary Bi Sheng said farewell to the lead age, greeted the electronic one, and drew a blueprint." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Low-volume funeral music was mingled in the mourning hall, in a solemn and respectful atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among groups who came to express their condolences, there were leaders, teachers, students of Peking University, and friends, colleagues, students, neighbors of Academician Wang Xuan, and also, many strangers who did not know him. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some of them held fresh flowers in their hands; some carried flower baskets; everybody, wearing small white flowers on their chests, slowly walked to the picture of Academician Wang Xuan, and bowed to express their condolences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many could not help but weep warm tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, who was the Director of the State's Cultural Relic Bureau and an old alumnus of Peking University, told the reporter that, more than ten years ago, when he worked in Henan Province, he invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation for cadres of the provincial Party Committee. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "The conduct and academic studies of Academician Wang Xuan are the model for us to learn. He made important contributions for the country and society, and people will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Jin Ruilin, a professor at Peking University's Law School, has been an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan for more than 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He just left the hospital several days ago, and insisted on coming today to say farewell to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Mr. Jin wrote his words in the visitors' book, he could not help but sadden and wipe the tears pouring from his eyes many times with tissues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told the reporter that Professor Wang Xuan lived a very simple life, "when he lived in Tongfu Yuan, he had already been a professor and had accomplished significant achievements. But he still lived in a very small one-level house for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He later moved to Chengze Yuan, where he had a space of 70 to 80 square meters, and lived there for more than ten years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He refused an offer when Peking University provided him a big 140-square-meter flat in the Academician Building located in Lan Qiying; he also refused an upper-floor flat provided by Fangzheng Building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin recalled and said with deep emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign countries, he simply refused to take positions with very good offers provided by foreign institutions. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "He insisted on not applying for the title of Academician at the beginning; then he gave up and filled out an application only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan went to get him moving him many times." </seg>
<seg id="22"> Another thing that moved Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan's attitude toward the training of young people, "he himself stressed many times that what should be found and relied on are not what achievements I have achieved, not myself, but the training of young people." </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that when Wang Xuan was around more than 50 years old, he started to pay attention to cultivating young people. He had stressed that we should pave a path, be willing to become a human ladder, and make way for young people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "It is not easy at all for a very accomplished scientist to do this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The reporter learned from the Peking University news center that the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan will open to the public for people coming from various circles to express their condolences from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day from 9 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 noon on February 19. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China to Implement Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (reporters: Zhou Wei and Li Fei). Many networks and websites currently rely on republishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their click rates, but many of them are neither authorized, nor pay related fees. To cope with this, Director of the Copyright Department of the State Copyright Bureau Wang Ziqiang said in a press conference, held by the News Office of the State Council on the 15th, that the State Council will explain about the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks, on the issue of paying for republishing works on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to existing laws and regulations, regarding those works published in newspapers, as long as their authors did not state that "they cannot be used," newspapers can use those works without their authors' permission, but at the same time should pay them, and the State Copyright Bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper reprint practices according to the law. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to regulations in existing laws, newspapers have the right to such legal permissions, but the Internet currently does not have rights for such legal permissions. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to related interpretations made by the People's Supreme Court, the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the Internet, i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the Internet, whose authors did not state that "they cannot be used," the Internet can use them without permission, but at the same time needs to pay their authors. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard, the Internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Regarding whether the Internet use of published small or short works applies to the legal permission, it still needs to be determined according to the laws." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether it will be included in a category of law depends on the confirmation of the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks this year." </seg>

<seg id="1"> (International) Russian Military Says Georgian Parliament's Resolution Will Not Affect Russia's Peacekeeping Activities </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15 (reporter: Song Shiyi). Xie Duofu, a news officer for the Russian Defense Ministry, told the media on the 15th that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia's peacekeeping troops will not affect the Russian military's peacekeeping activities in the short term, and Russian troops will continue to fulfill their peacekeeping mission in the conflict area of South Ossetia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Chair of the Russian Independent State Affairs Committee of the State Duma (lower house of the parliament), Kokoshin, made a speech and indicated regarding the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia's peacekeeping troops, on the same day the resolution was published, that the resolution will harm the stability of the situation in that area and negatively impact the relations between Russia and Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He stressed that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament is a further bad step toward damaging the relations between Russia and Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He thinks that the Georgian accusation against the Russian side is absurd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Georgian Parliament passed the resolution on that day, and requested Russia's peacekeeping troops to stop their peacekeeping activities in South Ossetia, but did not set a concrete deadline for Russia's peacekeeping troops to withdraw. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Georgian Parliament accuses Russia's peacekeeping personnel of a failure to fulfill their designated obligation, and regards the actions taken by Russia in the conflict area as "trying to annex Georgian territory." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Georgian Parliament requests the Georgian government to take an active action and consider inviting international peacekeeping troops - to be stationed in the conflict area of South Ossetia - to replace the peacekeeping activities currently undertaken by Russia in that area. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Georgian Parliament also requests the government to revise a related agreement that determined the stationing of Russia's peacekeeping personnel in the conflict area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> South Ossetia is an autonomous Georgian state, and borders with Russia's Republic of North Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It announced its own independence after the Soviet Union collapsed, and has been confronting Georgia's central government for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia currently has a peacekeeping battalion of 500 soldiers stationed in that area. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 16 (reporter: Zhou Liquan). After the large fire disaster occurred at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City in Jilin Province, an accident investigation group determined that 11 individuals are responsible, and among them, the head of the electrician team of the hospital, Zhang Diankun, and three other persons will be prosecuted as liable for the big accident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Central Hospital, the largest one in Liaoyuan City, experienced a big fire on December 15, 2005, which eventually took 39 lives. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The total burned area in this fire disaster was more than 5,000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As it has been learned, this is the biggest fire accident in the national medical and health system since New China was established. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As was investigated, at around 16:30 on the day the accident occurred, there was a sudden power failure at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City. Based on the hospital's electrical circuit design, if there is a power failure, the circuit breaker in the transformer box should automatically switch to a backup socket to maintain normal power supply for the hospital. But at that time the circuit breaker did not automatically switch to the socket. Zhang Diankun, the head of the technician team, forced the power supply without investigating and clarifying the cause of the power failure, and caused the fire disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Those smoky underground cables, which should be laid out on a flat surface in very good order, were tangled together without any order, and fire prevention layers should be set up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Thus, three individuals including Zhao Yongchun, the 57-year-old head of the electrical equipment installation team of the Textile Company of Liaoyuan City, Sun Fenglin, a retired cadre (senior engineer) from the Liaoyuan Power Affairs Bureau, and Jin Taicheng, a reemployed retiree worker at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, will be prosecuted as suspects in the liability for the big accident. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Central Organization Department of CCP Requires Further Strengthening of Supervision Work for Selection and Appointment of Leaders and Cadres </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16. The Central Organization Department recently printed and issued a suggestion regarding strengthening the supervision work for cadres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The suggestion requires that Party organization departments at every level should strictly control, care for, and protect cadres, and conduct supervision work for cadres at every stage of cadres' cultivation and education, review and test, selection and appointment, and routine management, and establish, perfect, and strengthen prevention work, promptly discover problems in the supervision work mechanism, seriously correct them, and truly strengthen the supervision work for selection and appointment of leaders and cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The suggestion points out that the primary tasks of the organization departments for cadre supervision include, first, supervision of the leadership team and leaders, and its priority is to strengthen supervision of the major leader of a leadership team; second, supervision of the selection and appointment work of leaders of the Party and administrations, and its priority is to supervise and review implementation of the Working Regulation on Selection and Appointment of leaders of the Party and Administrations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With regards to the supervision of the leadership team and leaders, the suggestion proposes that the ideal and good-faith education and anti-corruption and honesty promotion education should be consistently adhered to, and those educations should be practiced in cultivation, selection, control, and supervision of cadres, guide and urge leaders to strengthen their training of the Party spirit, and stick to strengthening the ideological and ethical frontline, emphasizing that the Party is established for the public, the administration is for the people, and anti-corruption is to prevent degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Honesty and self-discipline should clearly come up as requirements when talking with newly promoted cadres in their appointment meetings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Leadership teams at every level should be urged to stick to the democratic centralization system, establish and perfect rules and procedures for meetings and decision-making, and carefully practice the system that integrates collective leadership with individual responsibility in related fields. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supervision over the major leader of a leadership team should be emphasized. Leaders of organization (personnel) departments should frequently talk with and conduct heart-to-heart talks with the major leader of a leadership team at the next lower level to learn the status of his ideology, work, and style of work, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A routine control and supervision system should be established and perfected for leaders; the status of ideology and style of work of a leadership team should be regularly learned and analyzed, and suggestions and measures should be come up with to solve problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A warning talk and letter inquiry system for leaders should be practiced. Once the hint of a problem emerges, a warning talk or letter inquiry should be promptly conducted. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As for those obvious problems with leaders reported by the masses, they should be carefully investigated and clarified; if a problem is true, the leader concerned should be criticized and educated, or disciplined by appropriate organizational measures; if any leader violates any regulation or law, he or she should be transferred to the law or discipline enforcement organization to be investigated; if a leader is found innocent through an investigation, a clarification should be addressed for him or her in a proper manner. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, strengthening supervision of cadres should be integrated by encouraging cadres to boldly explore and develop innovations, and excellent cadres should be discovered and promptly commended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Suggestion requires that organization (personnel) departments at every level should truly strengthen the supervision work of selection and appointment of leaders of the Party and administrations. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Supervision measures on the stages of cadres' recommendation, nomination, test and review, discussion, and determination, etc., should be further perfected, and cadres should be strictly selected and used, and vigorous support should be provided for recommendation and selection of cadres who are politically reliable, talented at their work, maintain a good style of work, and are trusted by the masses of people to take leadership positions at every level. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The implementation status of the regulations for cadre appointment should be reviewed vigorously. Any conduct that violates the regulations for cadre appointment should be seriously investigated and disciplined, and indecent practices and corruption in the use of cadres should be firmly contained. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A supervision and investigation system for any serious violation of regulations for the use of cadres should be practiced to further strengthen supervision, investigation, and disciplinary work. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A system of selection and appointment of cadres - and investigation of their working responsibility - should be established and perfected. Based on the principle that power matches responsibility, every stage of the cadres' selection and appointment work, including the main body of responsibility and content of responsibility, should be scientifically defined, and an investigation method should be clarified to strengthen investigation work. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The supervision role played by the masses should be fully exercised to establish and perfect a reporting mechanism that is "convenient, secure, and highly efficient." </seg>
<seg id="19"> The supervision role played by public opinion should be fully employed, and the status of cadres' selection and appointment work should be notified to the news media within an appropriate amount of time, and accept the supervision of public opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The suggestion proposes that a coordination mechanism of cadre supervision work should be further perfected. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Organization (personnel) departments should strengthen coordination with discipline investigation organizations, establish a work communication system, contact person system, and responsibility system, with discipline investigation organizations in the aspect of cadres' fair administration and their Party spirit, in order to strengthen integrated supervision. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Visiting and investigation work should be carefully and well done with discipline investigation organizations; visiting and investigating methods can be improved and perfected to promote visiting and investigation quality. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An auditing system for leaders' economic responsibility should be carefully practiced with auditing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> An internal supervision mechanism for cadres' selection and appointment work of the organization departments should be perfected. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16 (reporter: Chen Jianxing). On the 15th, an economic affairs administration of the Taiwan authorities decided to fine Lianhua Electronics Corporation (shortened name: "Liandian"), one of "the two giant wafer producers" in Taiwan, 5 million New Taiwan Dollars, because it "violates regulation by providing assistance and participating in creation" for Hejian Science and Technology Company on the Mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case used by Taiwanese authorities to fine and discipline a Taiwanese business that invested on the Mainland since Chen Shui-bian came up with the economic and trade policy of "actively controlling and effectively opening." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As has been reported, a person from the Taiwan "Report and Review Committee of the Economic Department" said that the reason why Liandian was fined was because it violated "the Regulation of the People's Relation across the Strait," and regulations of "Permission Methods for Investment and Technological Cooperation on the Mainland." </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the future, the Report and Review Committee will fine Tsao Hsing-cheng, former Chair of the Board of Liandian, according to the circumstances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "Liandian Case" originated in February 2005, and by then Taiwanese investigation departments had used around a hundred people to hurriedly search the residences and offices of several high-level Liandian employees, and alleged that Liandian was suspected of investing on the Mainland and "illegally providing capital, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Science and Technology Company. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Tsao Hsing-cheng, the then-Chair of the Liandian Board, later publicly stated that Liandian did not violate any of the Taiwan authorities' regulations, and the assistance Liandian provided to Hejian Science and Technology was for Liandian's long-term interest, and Liandian would lose business opportunities if it did not enter the Mainland market as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After that, the "Financial Supervision and Control Committee" of the Taiwan authorities fined Liandian 3 million New Taiwan Dollars for its violation of the regulation regarding disclosure of commercial information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the Liandian Board accepted Tsao Hsing-cheng's resignation, and he was formally prosecuted for violation of regulations on investment on the Mainland within several hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Liandian and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (shortened name: TSMC) are called "the two giant wafer producers" in Taiwan, and both are leading high-tech enterprises on the island. </seg>

<seg id="1"> State Safety Supervision Bureau: Containment of Frequently-Occurring Large and Major Accidents in Coal Mines is Top of This Year's Priorities </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17 (reporter: Liu Zheng). Since four large mine accidents - in each of which around a hundred miners lost their lives - have continuously occurred, the serious situation of national safe production in the past year has caused "containment of frequently-occurring large and major accidents in coal mines" to become the highest among national safety supervision work priorities for this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The reporter learned from the State's Supervision and Control Bureau of Safe Production on the 17th that for the purpose of truly containing large and major accidents frequently occurring in coal or other mines, coal mines are the highest among priorities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The State's Supervision and Control Bureau of Safe Production will focus on the following three things for coal mine safety this year: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to effectively fight for gas control. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Extraction first and collection later" should be the priority for gas control this year. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If a shaft that has dense gas does not practice the method of "extraction first and collection later," it should be ordered by law to stop production immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to effectively fight for consolidation and closure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Those 5,243 shafts announced to the public, and more than 700 coal mine shafts recently reported from many local areas, should be completely and truly shut down. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Closure should be regarded as a regular activity, and those coal mines that damage resources, pollute the environment, and lack safe conditions, should be continuously shut down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Strengthen basic control of coal mine safety. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Immediately correct and stop losing management in a few big state-owned mines, and guide small mines that have mismanagement in establishing standard safety and management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Especially, major state-owned coal mines should be paid more attention to, and any productions exceeding their capacities, intensities, and fixed number of employees should never be allowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The controlled percentages for safe production for this year require the number of deaths in various accidents nationwide to be decreased 3% compared with that of last year, and among them, the number in coal mines to be decreased 3.5%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The number of large accidents that cause more than ten deaths each should be decreased by 5%, and among them, the number in coal mines should be decreased 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These controlled percentages have been announced to every provincial people's government, and local administrations are dividing them in terms of different levels and allocating them to grass-roots and businesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that there were 5,986 victims in coal mine accidents nationwide in 2005, and the number was 0.7% lower compared with that of last year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, large accidents that had more than ten victims each have increased, and the number of victims has increased 66.6% compared with that of last year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympic Games: Stimulant) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, February 17. News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency Reporters: Gao Peng, Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the "disaster of being jailed," many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to Russian women's biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva, who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the Winter Olympic Games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The first stimulant use scandal at the Turin Winter Olympic Games was exposed on the 16th, and Olga Pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been thrown out of the Winter Olympic Games, and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women's biathlon had been withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, the International Winter Biathlon Alliance determined to forbid Pyleva to participate in the sport for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The International Olympic Committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants, they will lose their qualification to participate in the Games, and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn, but they are not subject to legal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, according to Italian law, the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities. A law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants. Any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The International Olympic Committee had been "bargaining" with the Italian government for one year, and eventually reached an agreement last December. Both sides agreed that during the period of the Winter Olympic Games, any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to Italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Through the unremitting efforts made by the International Olympic Committee, the Italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympic Games, and promised that the police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athlete residences during the Olympic Games. But any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by Italian prosecution organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some reports said that Pescante, an official of the Italian government responsible for supervision of the Turin Winter Olympic Games, has transferred Pyleva's stimulant case to a Turin prosecution organization. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the International Olympic Committee and Pescante himself have not confirmed this so far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Andrey Dmytriev, a doctor for the Russian Biathlon Team ,disclosed at noontime on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin and returned home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who had been in a position at the World Anti-Stimulant Organization for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns home, this case might eventually "be settled by leaving it unsettled." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have not "completely addressed" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympic Games, and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if Italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on past penalty cases in which Italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants, the most serious penalty was merely a "two-year probation." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus, senior reporter Piali from the Italian ANSA said that the possibility of Pyleva being jailed is "very small," and at most, she might be fined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Piali also said that although an Italian court could sentence her by default, it is impossible for the Italian police to catch Pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the sentence, the Italian side can do nothing about it. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18. A comprehensive report by Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad: Bird flu is further spread on the African continent. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The World Health Organization confirmed on the 17th that birds have been found dead of infections by the bird flu virus in three areas of Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, France also first discovered the H5 bird flu virus; Europe and Africa are on high alert and strengthening prevention measures against the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Hussein Bushila, a consultant for the Eastern Mediterranean region of the WHO, told press in Egypt on the 17th that three areas in Egypt - including Cairo and Jizah in the central region, and Minya in the southern region - have found birds dead of H5N1 bird flu virus infection; Egyptian government departments have started to kill poultries suspected of being infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts pointed out that Egypt is an important passage for migrant birds in the Middle East and North Africa. The possibility of migrant birds bringing bird flu virus across borders is very high. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on import of any live poultries from foreign countries, and strengthened quarantine work at border ports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> More than 800 chickens died of unknown causes on a chicken farm in the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde, in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend imports of all poultries and pork from Nigeria, where the bird flu epidemic was discovered, and discontinued trade of poultries and related products in markets in border areas between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Cameroonian government has also established a monitoring and detection network that can cover its overall territories for epidemic detection. Its Bayside Center and the State Veterinary Laboratory are also under an emergency status so that they can deploy any test work associated with the H5N1 virus at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden initially excluded the epidemic on the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Swedish Veterinary Institute issued a test result that shows the dead swans found in Sweden this Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> An initial test result done by the Danish State Veterinary Control Bureau also showed that the 30 dead swans found in Danish territories in recent days were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But an agricultural department stated that Denmark still cannot lower its guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> 9 bird flu epidemic spots have been discovered in Romania in Eastern Europe this year. WHO experts in Bucharest said on the 17th that bird flu has spread to almost every area of the Delta Region of the Danube River, and the situation must be carefully coped with, and Romania might be continuously threatened by bird flu within 3 to 5 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Bangladesh in Asia, the government has taken every measure necessary to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Poultry Service Bureau has provided related officials books about prevention of bird flu, and also simultaneously organized poultry raisers for trainings. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18. As the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province disclosed, China's first blood sharing information data management and control network system has recently been formally established at the center and has been put into operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A leader involved with the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that any citizen who has freely donated his blood in any county (city, district) blood collection and supply institutions of Zhejiang Province will have a unique code record. When he donates blood again, information that determines if he is qualified to donate his blood will immediately show up as long as his code record, individual information, blood type, blood donation record, and time of last blood donation are entered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The leader further explained that if the system shows a free-blood donor is still within an interval period through entering the related code records, it will point out that the person does not meet the requirements for blood donation at this time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way it can protect not only the health of the blood donor, but also the health and safety of blood recipients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In addition, when the blood supply is in shortage, a blood donor or his relatives can have the right to use his blood first. As long as you enter a valid I.D. for the blood donor, his related information will show up, which is pretty convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As Today's Morning Journal of Hangzhou reported, the information system has currently been put into operation in 36 blood collection and supply institutions throughout the province. And the blood resources status for all of the blood collection and supply institutions in the province can also be shown in real time, which has accomplished data sharing throughout the province. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Residents of the 11 villages who were evacuated will be placed in 7 evacuation centers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Lerias said that the government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday, and today it sent people to check those villages because some of the villagers do not want to leave their homes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The mudslide incident occurred on the 17th close to a village located beside a mountain in St. Bernard Township in the southern part of South Leyte Province. Mud and rocks had buried the entire village, and only a few roofs could be seen from TV footage. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Since mud is very thick and wet, there is almost no hope for buried humans to survive. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At present, 109 people have been found dead and 57 people have been rescued. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London, the 6th (AFP) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London's Daily Express has reported that two laptop computers containing material on the probe into Princess Diana's fatal car crash in Paris in 1997 have been stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report says the theft has given rise to conjecture that the computers may contain confidential material from the investigation headed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the computers did not contain any sensitive information or any material linked to the probe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Lord Stevens is the chief constable of Northumbria Police in England. His office is located in Newcastle upon Tyne. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said detectives with the Northumbria Police have been investigating two burglaries in the last ten days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The first took place on the weekend of January 28 to 29 when the computers and cash were taken. The second burglary took place last week, but without any loss. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Northumbria Police also said there was no evidence that the two break-ins were linked to Lord Stevens' work. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Stevens has been investigating if the princess of Wales' death was not the result of a straightforward car accident. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 2004, Royal Coroner Burgess ordered further investigation into related evidence. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> Princess Diana died in a car crash in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997. Her lover, Fayed, and a chauffeur were also killed. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The unrelenting advance of bird flu across Europe is causing anxiety among the public. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The European Commission (EC) approved the establishment of "buffer zones" which would cover entire areas of infected countries and in which trade and transport of poultry products would be prohibited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In Africa, where the lethal H5N1 strain of the virus was discovered eight days ago in Nigeria, the disease has continued spread to more poultry farms and showed signs of having crossed the northern border into Niger. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Han Jie, Xu Bo) Reporters were informed on the 6th by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that two rules recently issued by the CBRC--the Electronic Banking Administration Measures and the Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide--will take effect on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A CBRC spokesman said that according to provisions of the Administration Measures, the examination and authorization method for foreign-capital financial institutions remains essentially unchanged. Namely, if foreign bank branches that have already been authorized to open online banking services need to add additional online banking products, their primary reporting bank must submit a consolidated application. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> , In June 2001, the China People's Bank promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Banking Operations to standardize use of the Internet by commercial banks in developing banking services. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A CBRC spokesman said that with the continuous development of the online banking operations of commercial banks, the Interim Measures no longer answered the need for supervision and control of risks in online banking. For this reason, the CBRC enacted the two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the CBRC spokesman, the CBRC's approval of the qualifications of security assessment organizations is different from the administrative approval of qualifications for industry access or market access. It is not a prerequisite for assessment organizations developing electronic banking security assessment services, but is instead only a reference for financial institutions choosing an assessment organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Financial institutions can hire a security assessment organization to perform e-banking security assessments as long as the assessment organization complies with relevant conditions and requirements, even if its qualifications have not undergone CBRC approval. Assessments must however be supervised in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Electronic Banking Administration Measures are divided into 99 items under nine chapters covering general principles, application and change of registration, risk management, management of information exchange and transfer, supervision of out-sourcing, supervision of trans-national business, oversight and administration, legal liability and supplementary provisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide is divided into 57 items under five chapters, covering general principles, security assessment organizations, implementation of security assessments, administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions. </seg>

Despite efforts to save him, he died in the early morning of the 6th in a hospital in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to Feng Yang, president of the Free State Chinese Association, the incident occurred in a bar in the city of Welkom, 130km northwest of Bloemfontein. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the time, the bar-owner Lin Yixing was behind the bar counter tidying some articles in preparation to end the business day. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Newspaper excerpt）Shanghai: Part-timers and University Grads Become Main Source of Hourly Workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) The Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security released on the 6th the "2006 Most Recent Guidance for Hourly Wages". It covers 120 kinds of positions--11 more than the last edition--and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to estimates by experts at the Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security, the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> China Youth Daily has reported that university graduates and part-timers are the main source of hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part-timers, with the percentage reaching 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The educational level of these part-timers is generally high, with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work, in which part-timers make up 81.7% of the manpower.  In the fitness industry, they occupy up to 61.6% of the positions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part-time work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to sources, the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply. Simultaneous interpretation is one such example. The monthly income for most hourly positions--such as part-time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony--can reach 2000 yuan or more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Another important reason that hourly part-time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one's knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, manager of an enterprise's human resources department, spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu says the greatest benefits of part-time work are the continuous upgrading of one's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field. Of course, the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements, they are gradually finding favor with many job-seeking graduates. Fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Initially, I wasn't interested in hourly work. But after a few months, I feel that it is better than a nine-to-five job." </seg>
<seg id="14"> After Young Huang graduated from university, he could not find a job he liked. Finally, he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "At 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment, I am very satisfied with my job. What I need now is to find more hourly jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to reports, hourly jobs have become an important route for job-hunting graduates to accumulate work experience, hone their work skills, improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills, such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work. These two fields account for 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly positions, such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks, do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Data shows that the unemployed make up 39% of hourly workers. The proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4% in retail-related positions and 58.7% in catering-related positions. Hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Experts: US Making Groundless Accusations by Playing Up "China Military Threat" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua)  (Reporters: Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review it formally submitted recently to Congress, the US Pentagon has said for the first time that China is "the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts say this is unreasonable finger-pointing at China's normal defense construction, an exaggeration of the "Chinese military threat" and an interference in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The 92-page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of China's military and the countermeasures the United States should take. The report makes 15 direct references to "China" or "Chinese" and says that "as an important emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States. If the United States fails to take countermeasures, China will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional U.S. military advantages". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, researcher with the Department of World Military Research at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, said that although senior US officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions, this is the first time that the US has said in the defense report that "China is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "It is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to Russia, India and China as rising strategic opponents and, in particular, focused more on the so-called 'Chinese military threat'," </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Worthy of note is that on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress. It included US$439.3bn earmarked for national defense. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the budget supplemented for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is included, the American national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top US$500bn to reach an all-time high," Peng Guangqian said. "This is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world's countries." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian says fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflects the Pentagon's consistent  style of "manufacturing  enemies", and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the colossal weapons industry groups of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the United States, China's national defense spending is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Military expert Deng Hongzhou, who has participated several times in the compilation of the white book on Chinese national defense, said that since the 1990s China's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed, but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall downward trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that compared with 1979, the proportion that China's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005, China's national defense expenditure was Rmb244.656bn, equal to only 1/14 that of the US; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1/60 that of the US and military expenditure per serviceman was equal to 1/30 that of the US military. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The US is about as large as China in terms of territory, but the difference in their military spending is so great. It is self-evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, director of the Research Department of the China Association of Armament Control and Disarmament, says that the US should objectively evaluate China's military construction and adds that China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the US will become military adversaries in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The 2004 China National Defense white book says that China keeps firmly to the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China is no threat to any country, either in the past, at present or in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> To date, China has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country. In contrast, the US keeps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in Asian alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Professor Zhu Feng of the College of International Relations, Beijing University says China and the US should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange, improve mutual understanding and trust, promote a constructive Sino-US partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> RAMALLAH, Feb. 9 (Xinhua)(International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Xinhua Reporters: Wang Hao, Huang Min) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Following the victory of Palestine's Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in parliamentary elections, how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kind of policies Hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the resistant attitude of the US and Israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the Hamas-lead government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, the different Palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subhead) Who Will Become Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since Hamas won the right to form a cabinet, some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the "Hamas Prime Minister" and the Palestinian leader, Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the leader of Hamas, Mashaal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that a Palestinian government formed by the leaders of Hamas would not recognize Israel, a hard-line signal that heightened international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The US and Israel have clearly stated they will not accept a Hamas-led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to Palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But this has not prevented Hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments, including a compromise policy of selecting independents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, in order to maximize recognition from the international community, in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of Hamas gathered in Egypt decided to select an independent figure, Ismail Haniyeh, chairman of the board of Gaza Islamic University, to become the new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Concerned parties have not yet responded to the move. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestinian analyst Hisham said that, whoever takes over the prime-ministership, the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down Hamas' hard-line character, since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (subhead) How will authority be distributed? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> From an internal perspective, the biggest challenge faced by the Hamas-led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An analysis in an article in the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam said that Hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office. Cooperation with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, or Fatah, will be the best solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> After the election, Hamas raise the possibility of a "political partnership" with Fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government, but until now Fatah has not given a positive response. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet. One faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway; another faction refuses the invitation by Hamas and wants instead to be "an active opposition" in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Informed sources say Fatah, with persuasion coming from Abbas, is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even so, Hamas and Fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts, but the actual name list is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In view of US and Israeli attitudes, a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Palestine's Basic Law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (subhead) How do the weapons fit in? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Hamas' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The US and Israel have an extremely hard-line attitude, insisting that Hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The leader of Hamas, Mashaal, emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the organization's "strategic choice". </seg>
<seg id="31"> The issue of weapons in reality includes two levels:  the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> That Hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally. It will, through similarly legal methods, try to integrate its armed branch, the Al-Qassam Brigade, into the government's security apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a Palestinian national force, or "People's Army", but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the Palestine Islamic Jihad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel, the vast majority of which are from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Fatah Hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Responsible for forming a cabinet, Hamas will have to come to terms with Fatah regarding how to manage these various self-governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to local media reports, Abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces. The police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Li Jianmin) China's State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has issued the 2005 China Annual Polar Exploration Report, the first of its kind since China began scientific polar exploration more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Report reflects the polar exploration activities, polar expedition logistics, and the main progress and achievements made during China's polar scientific studies in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Report records that at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing Time) the Chinese Antarctic Expedition's Inland Icecap Exploration Team successfully scaled Dome A, the highest inland icecap in Antarctica, and determined at 3:15 a.m. on January 18 (Beijing Time) that the elevation of the highest point of Dome A is 4093m. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the increasingly competitive stage of international polar investigation, Chinese took the lead in charging the 'highest point on the Antarctic icecap' and achieved success in one go by relying on their adamant will, intrepid spirit and courage to break new ground, realizing another dream for mankind in Antarctica," </seg>
<seg id="6"> said SOA Director Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Report says that on March 24, 2005, the 21st Chinese expedition to Antarctica returned to Shanghai after successfully fulfilling its mission. The expedition took 151 days and covered 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, the 22nd Chinese Antarctic expedition left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station in Antarctica, where it will carry out scientific investigation activities. It will leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai by way of Australia at the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because it is China's first polar expedition report, the 2005 China Annual Polar Exploration Report also includes a retrospective and summary of China's exploratory undertakings in the polar regions since they began in the 1980s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the Report, China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983, becoming a member country of the Antarctic Treaty Organization and other most influential international organizations for Antarctic affairs, including Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee, winning the right to speak and participate in decision-making in international polar affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Report points out that over a period of more than 20 years China's polar explorations "started from scratch, continuously developed and took on scale", now consisting of a "three stations, one vessel" system for scientific exploration in the Antarctic and Arctic; that is: the Antarctic Great Wall Station set up in February 1985, the Antarctic Zhongshan Station set up in February 1989, the Arctic Yellow River Station set up in July 2004 and "Snow Dragon" polar expedition ship that has carried out Arctic and Antarctic exploration functions since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to statistics contained in the Report, as of the end of 2005, China had organized 22 scientific Antarctic expeditions, 2 Arctic scientific expeditions using the Snow Dragon as a carrier platform and 2 Arctic expeditions at the Yellow River Station. So far, more than 3000 Chinese expeditioners have participated in field investigations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We are currently conducting research on the feasibility of a third Antarctic exploration station. This is also China's first feasibility study into an inland station in Antarctica." </seg>
<seg id="15"> said Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After more than 20 years of endeavor, China has now gained a footing in world polar exploration. However, compared to other major polar exploration countries, there still exists a large gap and we must catch up," </seg>
<seg id="17"> he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui revealed that China will issue a report on polar expeditions on an annual basis in the future. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> TOKYO, February 13 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Qian Zheng) Researchers at Tokai University in Japan have developed a bioartificial kidney. It not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components. Additionally, it is small in size and easy to transplant. As more detailed research is carried out, there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a recent report by the Japan Light Industry News, the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts. One part is composed of "artificial nephrons" that filter metabolic matter and water from blood; the other part consists of the "artificial renal tubules" the extracts water, amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread. The inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis --dialysis-related amyloidosis-- to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood. At the same time, it can also cause the glucose, vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the past, artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely. They were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats. Epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, the researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had successfully served its function. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are currently developing a bioartificial kidney that uses human kidney cells and will conduct clinical studies after its safety has been verified. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Safe Electricity Production in China Still Faced with Difficult Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua)(Reporter: An Pei) An official with the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) said on the 13th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005, it still faces difficult challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said at the Fifth (Expanded) Meeting of the National Electricity Safe Production Committee held here that China's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005, with the task of supplying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized. The impact of natural disasters was actively countered, thereby essentially ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power system. Accidents involving safe power production equipment or the general power grid showed a dramatic year-on-year reduction, while the health of power equipment was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power-generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include the following: electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region-specific, season-specific and time-specific basis; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them; at the same time, the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control, seriously affecting the stable operation of power-generating sets; the weak structure and outdated equipment of some power grids cause hidden problems in system safety; the frequent occurrence of accidents in the construction of electric power infrastructure has not been turned around and the situation remains grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system. The new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal, orderly production. </seg>

<seg id="1"> SA Envoy: No Organized Criminal Activities Against Chinese Nationals in South Africa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua)(Reporters: Wang Jiangang, Hao Yalin) Vusi B. Koloane, charge d'affaires of the South African embassy in China, said on the 13th in an exclusive interview with a Xinhua reporter that there in no organized criminal effort against Chinese nationals in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He also said the South African government would do everything possible to "fight all forms of criminal activity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero" and wants the safety of the lives and property of every foreigner working in South Africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> So far, four Chinese citizens have been murdered in South Africa in 2006, causing a widespread expression of concern from the Chinese community. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised the issue with South Africa and warned Chinese citizens traveling to South Africa to be more aware of safety precautions. It also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi B. Koloane said, "We feel sorry for what has happened and ask the Chinese people to believe that the government of South Africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving Chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully solved the case of Chen Jianqing, a woman from Fujian, China who was murdered in South Africa on February 5. One suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Police are currently hunting another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore, the South African embassy in China has revealed that South African police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a Hong Kong businessman in January this year and that the victim's possessions have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Speaking of the impact that the killing of Chinese citizens might have, Vusi B. Koloane said that the incidents would "definitely" have a negative impact on business, tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries, but the impact would "probably be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to Manqoba Nyembezi, tourism attache with the South African embassy in China, the South African embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to official Chinese statistics, South Africa continued to remain China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Bilateral trade grew 23% year-on-year to US$7.27bn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, tourism industry sources said the serial killings of Chinese citizens in South Africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Statistics from the South African Tourism Board show that 20,331 Chinese tourists visited South Africa in the first half of 2005, representing a year-on-year decrease of 14.9%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Approximately 200,000 Chinese currently live in South Africa. They are spread throughout South Africa's cities, town and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in South African society, high unemployment, the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not understand English, they keep cash on their person and in their homes, making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money. </seg>

<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)(Reporter:  Li Jiangtao) After days of intensive arrangements, the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University formally opened at 9:00 on the 15th. By noon, hundreds of people had come to pay their last respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> By just after 8:00, before the morning hall was scheduled to open, scores of people had lined up outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University, this reporter saw a black banner hanging on the wall. It read  "Profound Grieving for Academician Wang Xuan". </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner was a huge funerary portrait more than ten square meters in size. In it, he wore glasses and had a slight smile, reflecting his refined temperament. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On both sides of the funerary portrait stood several cypresses. Scores of wreaths were lined up on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On one of the wreaths, an elegiac couple read "Chinese printing originated in Qin and flourished in the Tang. Contributed to the replacement of letter printing with electronic printing". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) (Reporters: Zhou Wei, Li Fei) Many websites rely on large-scale retransmission of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase hits. But many have not been authorized to do so and have not paid any fees. To counter this, said Director-General of the Copyright Department of the National Copyright Administration Wang Ziqiang at a news conference held by the State Council on the 15th, the State Council's impending Information Network Transmission Right Protection Regulations will respond to the issue of fees for the transmission of Internet works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect, works already published in a newspaper or magazine, if an author fails to make a "Not for Use" declaration, magazines and newspapers can use the work without the author's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration. In accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations, the State Copyright Bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for retransmission of newspapers and magazines. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the laws and regulations currently in effect, while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization, Internet sites do not have the same right. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to a related judicial interpretation by the Supreme People's Court, the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the Internet, so that short articles published in newspapers, magazines and on the Internet can be used on the Internet without acquiring permission if the author has not made a "Do Not Use" declaration, with the user being required to pay remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards, in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "On the issue of whether legal authorization applies to the use on the Internet of short articles that have already been published, this still needs to be determined at the legal level." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> CHANGCHUN, February 16 (Xinhua) (Reporter: Zhou Liquan) Following a large fire in a hospital in the city of Liaoyuan in Jilin province, an accident investigation team has determined eleven individuals to be responsible. These include the supervisor of the electrician team, Zhang Diankun, and four other individuals who will be prosecuted for gross negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire at the largest hospital in Liaoyuan, the Central Hospital, resulted in 39 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The fire covered an area of more than 5000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to reports, it was the largest fire to occur in the national healthcare system since the foundation of new China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> An investigation has revealed that the incident began on that day at approximately 1630hrs when electricity to the Liaoyuan Central Hospital suddenly stopped. According to the hospital's circuitry design, if power is cut, the switch in the transformer box automatically activates a backup switch that maintains the normal supply of power to the hospital. In this case, the backup switch failed to automatically activate and Electrician Team Supervisor Zhang Diankun forced the resumption of power without checking the cause of the outage. This resulted in the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Furthermore, there were more than ten cables that were tangled together among the underground electrical cables that were giving off smoke. This kind of electrical cable should be neatly arranged and a fire protection layer should be installed. </seg>

<seg id="11"> carefully investigate prominent problems regarding leading cadres reported by the masses; those who indeed have problems should be subject to criticism, education or relevant organizational treatment according to the seriousness of the case; those who have broken discipline and laws should be turned over to the law enforcement authorities; when no problem is found following investigation, clarification should be made in a suitable manner. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, it is necessary to combine the supervision of cadres with motivating cadres to boldly explore, blaze new trails and innovate. Attention should be paid to the discovery and commendation of outstanding cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The opinions call on the organization (personnel) department at all levels to practically strengthen supervision of the selection and appointment of leading cadres in the Party and government; </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Chen Jianxing) The economic administration authorities of the Taiwan government decided on the 15th to fine United Microelectronics Corporations (UMC)--one of the "two titans of Taiwan's chip industry"--NT$5 million for "unlawfully aiding and participating in the establishment" of He Jian Technology in mainland China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first time Taiwan authorities have penalized a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian came up with a stance of advocating a cross-strait economic policy of "active management, effective liberalization". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the report, individuals attached to the Investment Commission of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said UMC was fined because it had violated the Statute Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area as well as the Measures Governing Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Investment Commission will fine UMC's former chairman Tsao Hsing-Cheng and others after reviewing the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "UMC Case" began in February, 2005, when Taiwanese investigators sent nearly a hundred people to raid the homes and offices of several UMC executives, saying UMC was suspected of "illegally providing funds, technology and human resources" to Hejian Technology, a mainland company in which UMC had invested. </seg>
<seg id="7"> UMC's chairman at the time, Tsao Hsing-Cheng, publicly stated after the event that UMC had not breached any of the Taiwan government's regulations and that UMC's help to Hejian Technology was in UMC's long-term interest because UMC would lose business opportunities if it failed to quickly enter the mainland market. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Afterwards, the Taiwan government's Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$3 million for contravening regulations on the disclosure of business information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> UMC's board accepted Tsao Hsing-Cheng's resignation on January 9, 2006. A few hours later, Tsao Hsing-Cheng was officially indicted for alleged illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> UMC and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), which have been called the "two titans of Taiwan's chip industry", are the island's hi-tech giants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A series of investigations into UMC by Taiwanese authorities have been closely watched by all sectors of society on the island. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> JINAN, February 17 (Xinhua)(Zhang Yuqing, Shen Yaoqin) Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute recently performed successful heart transplant surgery on an infant. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th, reporters saw that the infant's face was plump and red 51 days after the surgery and all monitoring and prognostic indicators were normal. He had smoothly passed through the critical period of the surgery and was now cheerfully playing with toys bought for him by hospital staff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The doctor examining him that day explained that when the sick infant from the rural district of Tai'An in Shandong was brought to the hospital by his parents, his entire body was blue and purple and he was having difficulty breathing. Following a medical examination, he was diagnosed as suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease that would require a heart transplant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Heart transplant surgery is the most difficult, risky and complicated of all heart surgeries. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is especially true when it involves a heart transplant in an infant under one year old, something that had never been done in China. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute organized specialists who  deliberated into the night, meticulously designing a surgical and post-operative-monitoring plan. They devised innovations of their own in the method of vascular anastomosis and carried out tests on animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At 8:00 a.m. on December 28, 2005, the surgery officially began. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The donor heart came from an infant that had died after sudden respiratory-and-heart failure caused by a congenital lung malformation. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The surgery required the anastomosis of six arteries and more than 510 sutures, with the distance between sutures not exceeding 3mm. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Liu Zheng) Following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people, the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made "curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents" the most urgent task in national work safety this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This reporter was informed on the 17th by the State Administration of Work Safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> To make coal mines safer this year, the State Administration of Work Safety will take a strong hold over the following three items: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Control of gas this year must give prominence to "draining gas before mining coal". </seg>
<seg id="7"> If high gassy mines fail to "drain gas before mining coal", they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The 5243 coal-mine and coal-pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one, as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Closures must become a part of routine work, with coal mines that destroy resources, pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Strengthen administration of coal-mine safety infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The deterioration of management in the small number of large state-owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled, while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In particular, key state-owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity, strength or manpower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3% drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents, including a 3.5% drop in accidents in coal mines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5%, while in the coal mines they must decrease 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These control standards have been transmitted to the people's governments of the various provinces. The various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005, which represents a 0.7% decrease year on year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed, with the number of deaths increasing 66.6% year on year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> TURIN, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Likely to End Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Reporters: Gao Peng, Ding Ying) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the Turin Winter Olympics could face a "prison term", but judging from things as they stand now, chances are slim that this will happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, leading figure in the first doping scandal of these Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the 16th, the Turin Winter Olympics saw its first doping scandal uncovered when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedron, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The following day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women's 15km individual biathlon at these Winter Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, the International Winter Biathlon Union decided to ban her from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has been a consistent rule of the International Olympic Committee that any athlete found to have used performance-enhancing drugs at an Olympics Games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation, but will receive no legal penalty. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But under Italian law, athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants. Judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance-enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In December last year, after one year of "bargaining", the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this Winter Olympics in accordance with Italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Following unremitting efforts by the International Olympic Committee, Italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the Winter Olympics to a promise that police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athletes' dwellings during the Winter Olympic Games. But athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by Italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Reports say that Pescante, the Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, had referred the Pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in Turin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But neither the International Olympic Committee nor Pescante himself has yet confirmed the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin to return to her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who worked for years in the World Anti-doping Agency, said that once Pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng added that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government had never been "thorough" in their anti-doping drive at the Winter Olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if Italian prosecutors did step in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on past instances of punishment handed down to Italian athletes that have used performance-enhancing drugs, the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than "two years of prison term served on probation". </seg>
<seg id="18"> For this reason, senior reporter of Italy's ANSA [pei ai]predicted that the possibility of Pyleva going to prison was "exceedingly slim" and that a fine would be the most she would receive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> also said  that although an Italian court can pass judgment in absentia, it would be impossible for the Italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refused to accept a judgment, there would be no way Italian authorities could detain her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) Bird flu has spread further on the African continent, says a summary report by a Xinhua overseas reporter. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The World Heath Organization (WHO) confirmed on the 17th that birds killed by the bird flu virus have been found in three regions in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, the H5 bird flu virus has also been found in France for the first time. Europe and Africa are on high alert and are strengthening anti-epidemic measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Hasan al-Bushra, advisor to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, said that at present dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been discovered in  Cairo and Giza in central Egypt and three areas in Minya in the country's south. The responsible departments of the Egyptian government have begun to slaughter domestic fowl that could be infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts say that Egypt is an important passage for migratory birds traveling to the Middle East and North Africa, so it is very likely that the bird flu virus was brought into the country by migrating birds. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on live fowl imports and will reinforce quarantine inspections at border entries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A poultry farm in Cameroon's capital Yaounde saw more than 800 birds die in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to call an immediate temporary halt to all imports of fowl and pork from Nigeria, where bird flu has occurred. It also called a temporary halt to the trade of fowl and related products in all markets in the border area between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With little delay, Cameroon's government also set up an epidemic monitoring network covering the entire border. The country's Pasteur Center and the National Veterinary Laboratory are also on an on-call state of alert so that laboratory tests related to the H5N1 virus can be initiated at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the presence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Laboratory test results released by Sweden's National Veterinary Institute show that the Swedish swans found dead Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Preliminary laboratory results by Denmark's National Veterinary Administration have also indicated that thirty dead swans found recently within Denmark's borders were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the Department of Agriculture said that Denmark cannot yet lower its guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Romania in Eastern Europe has had nine bird flu outbreaks so far this year. A WHO expert said on the 17th in Bucharest that almost every area in the Danube Delta region has seen cases of bird flu and that the situation must be treated seriously, adding that Romania may continually be threatened by bird flu over the next three to five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Asia, the government of Bangladesh has taken all necessary measures to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided books on the prevention of bird flu to relevant officials and at the same time has organized training for poultry farmers. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) The Blood Center of Zhejiang Province has revealed that China's first blood supply data management and control network system recently was formally established at the center in recent days and put online. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> An official from the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that from now on when any citizen in any county (municipality, district) in Zhejiang Province donates blood at an organization that supplies and collects blood, there will be a unique record number. When he donates blood again, the corresponding record number just needs to be entered and information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation records, date of last blood donation and whether blood donation is permitted will immediately appear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The official explained further that if when the corresponding record number is entered the system says the required period between blood donation is not yet over, it will indicate conditions to donate blood on this occasion have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will not only help protect the health of the blood donor, but will also help protect the health and safety of the blood user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Futhermore, when blood supply is limited, blood donors and their families will have a preferential right to blood. You only need to enter a valid blood donor ID and the blood donors data will immediately appear. It is extremely convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 6 from Beijing (reporters Han Jie and Xu Bo).  The reporters have learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that the "Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking" and "Guidelines on Electronic Banking Security Evaluation " the CBRC has released will be implemented on February 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A spokesperson for the CBRC said that according to the stipulations of the administrative methods, the relevant examination and approval methods of foreign capital financial organizations has basically not changed.  Even after branches of foreign banks obtain approval to open online bank services, if they need to add new online banking services the main reporting branch bank within the borders of China should carry out notification and evaluation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To standardize the utilization of the Internet for banking services by commercial banks, the People's Bank of China formulated and issued the "Temporary Methods for Online Banking Administration." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The spokesperson for the CBRC said that with the continuous development of electronic banking services among commercial banks, the temporary methods can no longer accommodate the needs of electronic banking risk supervision, therefore the CBRC formulated these two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to their spokesperson, the CBRC's firm belief in the qualification of security evaluation institutions is different from the administrative approval of qualification characteristics of industry or enterprise admittance.  It is not that the evaluation institutions are opening up required conditions for banking security evaluation, it's just a reference for financial institutions to select evaluation institutions with. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as security evaluation institutions are in accordance with the relevant conditions and demands, even if they have not had their qualifications recognized by the CBRC, financial institutions can still use them to implement electronic banking security evaluation, but they should carry out management according to the relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The "Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking" has 99 articles in 9 chapters. It is divided into General Provisions, Application and Modifications, Risk Management, Data Exchange and Transfer Management, Outsourcing Management, Cross-border Business Management, Supervision and Regulation Management, Legal Liability and Supplementary Provisions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Selected Best of Newspapers and Periodicals) Shanghai: Persons with Concurrent Jobs and Graduates of Institutions of Higher Education Become Main Force of Hourly Wage Earners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 7 from Beijing. Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security announced its 'Guide to Minimum Hourly Wages for 2006' on February 6.  The number of jobs covered reached 120, 11 more than last time.  Wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to the estimations of relevant experts at the Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security, Shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report in "China Youth Magazine," graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs (holding two or more jobs at once) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs, it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs.  The proportion of this group reaches 51.1% of the whole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high, they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures, such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7%, and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to our understanding, some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of RMB, such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation.  The majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 RMB or more, such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs, wedding masters of ceremonies, and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Satisfying personal interests and expanding one's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, who holds the position of manager of the Human Resources Department of a certain enterprise, will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates, and he has opportunities to be involved in another area.  Of course, a monthly income of 2000 RMB also has a certain attraction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds, the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions.  Among those making hourly wages, 14% are university or technical school graduates of the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "At first I didn't want to work for hourly wages, but after a few months, I think it's better than going to work from nine to five." </seg>
<seg id="14"> After college student Huang graduated, the job she found wasn't very ideal.  Finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am very satisfied with my current job.  I make 100 RMB an hour, and the environment is good, what I want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to our understanding, hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience, exercise their working skills, increase their communication techniques, and grow social experiences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures, such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era-stylistic performance art positions.  Their proportion of hourly wages is 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly work positions have lower technical skills, such as food sales promoter and tally clerks.  Unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39%, among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 68.4% of workers that were unemployed, and a proportion of 58.7% among food and beverage jobs.  Hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Puts Forth 'Key Science Research Plan' for Next 15 Years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 9 from Beijing, (reporter Li Xing).  To increase the international competitiveness of China, greatly further maintainable development, and realize key development leaps, the "National Mid to Long Term Science and Technology Development Plan Guidelines (2006-2020)" released by the State Council on February 9 deploys four key science research plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> These four key science research plans are protein research, particle control research, nano research, and growth and procreation research. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The guidelines point out that protein science is the strategic highpoint in life sciences being intensely fought over in developed nations at present. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China must place emphasis on researching the key biology fields of transcriptomics, protein science, metabonomics, structural biology, and the functions and mutual effects of protein biology, system biology and protein biology with correlated calculations, methodology for protein research and basic research for relevant applications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The guidelines also believe that particle control research has an obvious forward looking nature and will likely produce a hard to calculate influence on human social and economic development 20 to 30 years from now. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China must put emphasis on researching particle communications mediums and control concepts and methods, particle computation, new particle effects limited to small particle systems, new concepts and new technical foundations for particle control attributes and measurement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Besides this, the guidelines point out, nano science and technology has already become the strategic choice for many nations in improving their core competitiveness and is also an area in which China hopes to realize great leaps in development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China's key research into this area will include the controlling methods of nano materials, self assembly and functionality, nanoelectronics, nano biology and nano medicine, nano scale attributes and measurement science, as well as effects of nano material and nano technology in energy resources, the environment, information technology, medicines, and other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> China's population growth is large and its inadequacies are many, organ transplants are seriously short and the peak of an aging society will soon arrive - therefore China urgently needs breakthroughs and technical innovations in growth and procreation science theory. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the guidelines, from 2006 to 2020 China will place emphasis on researching cell growth, division and control, the arising, maturing and impregnation of reproductive cells, the decline of human reproductive functions and the mechanisms of degenerative changes, safety and morals of aided reproduction and stem cell technology. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Expert: America Beating Drum of 'Chinese Military Threat' is Irrational Criticism </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua New February 9 from Beijing (reporters Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping)  The Pentagon's "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" formally handed over to Congress in recent days has for the first time referred to China as 'the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to America'. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts believe this is an irrational criticism of China's normal defense construction, a dramatization of the 'Chinese military threat theory', and is an interference in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" is the Pentagon's new national defense policy paper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of Chinese military force and what paths America should take to meet this problem.  The report directly brings up 'China' or 'Chinese' a total of 15 times, saying 'as a major and newly prosperous large nation, China has the most potential to carry out military competition with America.  If America does not have counter-measures, China will likely develop destructive military technologies, thus breaking America's advantage in conventional weapons.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Researcher Yao Yunzhu of the World Military Research Department of the China Military Science Institute says that, although high level American officials have expressed similar views many times before, this is the first time America put forward that 'China is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to America' in its 'defense strategy reports'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> 'This report for the first time clearly takes Russia, India, and China as newly rising strategic opponents, among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called Chinese military threat theory.' </seg>
<seg id="8"> Said Major General Peng Guangqian, researcher of the China Military Science Institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Worth noting is that on the same day that the "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" was formally handed in, American President Bush also handed to Congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007, in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion USD. </seg>
<seg id="10"> 'If you add on to this the budget for the military movements in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion USD, setting a new historic high' Peng Guangqian said. 'This is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian believes that the method of America concocting 'threat theories from other countries' reflects the Pentagon's usual style of 'creating enemies.'  Its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures, and dredging up even more profits for America's huge military industrial complex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts say, compared with America's huge military expenditures, China's defense expenditures are relatively limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Military expert Deng Hongzhou, who has taken part in the writing of China's Defense White Paper several times, said that since the 1990's, along with economic development, China's defense expenditures have increased, but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979, China's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005, China's defense expenditures were 244.656 billion RMB, equal to only approximately 1/14 of America's.  Average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1/60 of America's.  Per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1/30 of America's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> 'America's land area is about equal to China's land area, but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference.  It is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs.' </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, Director of the Research Department of China's Military Control and Disarmament Association, expressed that America should objectively appraise the situation of China's military construction. China's peaceful development does not mean that China and America will become military opponents in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The "China's Defense in 2004" White Paper said China staunchly follows the path of peaceful development, and carries out a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China has never become a threat to any country in the past or present, and will not become a threat in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Up until now, China has not established military bases in any country, and has not sent one soldier to any other country, while America has over 100 military bases abroad, and in the Asian Pacific region alone has in excess of 100,000 military forces deployed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Professor Zhu Feng of Beijing University's International Relations Institute said that China and America should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges, increase understanding and mutual trust, comprehensively further Chinese and American constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 9 from Ramallah (Internationl Observation). Hamas Looks for Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News reporter Hao Huangmin </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the Palestine Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) obtained victory in legislative elections, how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kinds of new policies Hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the attitude of resistance of America and Israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the Hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, various Palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation, and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (Sub Heading) Who Will the Position of Premier Fall to? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, there have been people in the outside world who worry a 'Hamas Premier' will likely see differently than the current high leader Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Also, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, emphasized that the new Palestinian government established by Hamas leaders will not continue to recognize Israel.  This intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="11"> America and Israel explicitly state they will not accept a Hamas government that controls real power, and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this has not obstructed Hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, to acquire international approval across the largest range possible, earlier domestic and foreign Hamas leaders meeting together in Egypt decided to choose independent Ismail Haniyeh, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Islamic University in Gaza, to be appointed the new premier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This move has still not received the responses of concerned parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestine Analyst Hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to, what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the 'hard' aspects of Hamas as much as possible.  Only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Sub Heading) How to Allocate Power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Looking at the internal makeup of the party, the biggest challenge that Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Palestine "Daily" published an analysis saying that while Hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects, in the area of being in power it lacks experience.  Hamas cooperating with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience being in power, would be the best strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner' relationship with Fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government, however Fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Opinions among those in the Fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same.  One faction advocates participating in the new government, and thus having something to say; another faction refuses the invitation of Hamas, and would rather be an 'active opposition faction' in the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of Abbas, Fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although this might be the case, Hamas and Fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Besides this, another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has also designed a technocracy government, but the concrete list of names is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In light of the attitude of Israel and America, a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to regulations of the Palestine "Basic Law," after the new legislature convenes on the February 16, the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Sub Heading) At a Loss About Armed Forces </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The weapons in the hands of Hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces. </seg>
<seg id="29"> America's and Israel's attitude is extremely stiff.  They staunchly demand Hamas give up violence, and reject Hamas taking part in government while carrying guns. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mashal emphasized on February 9 that armed resistance is the 'strategic choice' of his organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems: The legality of weapons, and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner, allowing its subordinate armed faction the 'Qawasameh tribe' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government's security organizations. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a Palestine ethnic power organization 'people's army.'  However it did not get a broad response, and also took criticism from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At present, Palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel, the vast majority of which come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Also, Fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations, such as the 'al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades' and the 'Fatah Hawks' and others. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must come to an understanding with Abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures, and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to the reports of local media, Abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments, while the police and people's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the Department of the Interior of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue, and as of now there is nothing further. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The "Report" shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic Survey Team successfully completed their task and returned to Shanghai.  Their tour of research lasted 151 days, a voyage of 26,500 knots. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic Survey Team left Shanghai, going to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific investigation activities, and will leave Zhongshan Station at the end of February 2006 to return to Shanghai via Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because this is the first time China has released its polar region survey report, the "2005 China Polar Region Survey Report" also carried out a review and summary of Chinese polar region surveys beginning in the early 1980's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the "Report", in 1983 China formally entered the "Antarctica Treaty", became a member country of the Antarctica Treaty System, and also became a negotiating country in the Antarctica Treaty, a member of the Antarctica Science Research Committee, a member of the Antarctica Council, and other influential international organizations dealing with Antarctica. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee, winning the right to decide policy and speak in international polar region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The "Report" points out that in over 20 years, China's polar region surveys have "continuously developed from nothing and for the first time have real scope."  The Antarctic and Arctic Science Survey System already has "three stations and one ship," that is: Changcheng Station established in February 1985 in Antarctica, Zhongshan Station established in February 1989 in Antarctica, Huanghe Station established in July 2004 in the Arctic, and the "Xuelong" class polar survey ship that began to undertake survey missions to the Arctic in 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The "Report" estimates that as of the end of 2005, China had already organized 22 Antarctic Science Surveys, two Arctic Science Surveys using the "Xuelong" as a platform, and two survey's from the Huanghe Arctic Station.  As of the present, China already has sent over 3000 people to personally go to the Antarctic or the Arctic to carry out on-sight surveys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "At present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third Antarctic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for China." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After over 20 years of hard work, China's polar region survey enterprise already has a definite position among the world's polar region surveys.  However, compared with the other main polar region surveying countries, there still exists a relatively large discrepancy.  We must push on ahead." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui revealed, China will publish polar region survey reports every year from now on. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Tokyo (reporter Qian Zheng)  Researchers of Japan's Tokai University have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney.  It not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, it also has functions to maintain useful substances.  It has a small volume, is easy to transplant, and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in previous days in the "Nikkei Business Daily", the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts.  One part is the 'artificial kidney unit' that strains out waste material and water from blood, the other part is the 'artificial urine tubes' that returns water, amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The 'artificial kidney unit' and the 'artificial urine tubes' are both made up of hollow fibers.  The inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of 'amyloid degeneration related to dialysis' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood, while also allowing the glucose, vitamins, minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste, and could not totally get rid of everything.  They also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney.  Pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used . </seg>
<seg id="8"> After two weeks, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney was functioning. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Safe Production of Electricity Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing (reporter An Bei).  An official of the State Electricity Supervision Committee said on February 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend, the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Shi Yubo, Chairman of the State Electricity Supervision Committee, said at the 5th (expanded) State Electricity Safe Production Committee Conference being held in Beijing that China's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend.  It satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer peaks, realized the safe supplying of energy, actively responded to the attack of natural disasters, and basically assured the safe and stable operations of the electricity system.  Safe electricity production facility accidents and normal electricity grid accidents saw a large decrease over that of last year, and the health level of electricity facilities received enhancement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups, safe electricity production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include the continued existence of regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight.   The supply of electricity coal (coal used in generating electricity) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism.  At the same time, the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls, seriously influencing the stable operations of generator groups.  The structure of some electricity grids are weak, facilities are old and bring hidden problems to system safety.  The situation of common electricity infrastructure accidents has still not received a fundamental turn around, and the trend is still grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system, many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed.  The new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce, and secure a normal production order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006, Shi Yubo expressed that we must further solidify the basic tasks of safe electricity production management, speed up the establishment and perfection of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms, and increase the ability to handle unexpected incidents.  In addition, we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant grid and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system.  We must also continue to do the tasks of supervision management and informational construction for large dam hydro electric plants, assure the safety of large dams, strengthen safety management of electricity construction, and decrease the occurrence of injuries or deaths from accidents.  Finally, we must continue to strengthen information reporting tasks and ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and free flow of electricity safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to our understanding, by uniting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modifications and perfections of the already published "Temporary Investigation Regulations on Electricity Production Accidents" this year, while the relevant accompanying documents on large hydro electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005 China's use of electricity reached 2.468 trillion kilowatt hours, a 13.5% increase over the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non-advantageous situations, various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management.  Last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation's electricity production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> 74 electricity grid accidents occurred, a decline of 127 from the previous year.  427 facility accidents occurred, a decline of 132 from the previous year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since the beginning of 2006, there have already been 4 Chinese citizens that have been murdered in South Africa.  The Chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already put forward discussion of this to South African parties, and warned Chinese citizens traveling in South Africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge.  Overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express the most sincere condolences and mourning to the families of those murdered." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Koloane said, "We feel apologetic because of this.  Please allow the people of China to believe that the South African government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves China." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the statement of the Chinese Embassy in South Africa, South African police have already successfully broken the case of Chinese Fujian female Chen Jianqing's murder on February 5, and one suspect is already arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At present the police are pursuing another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also according to the South African Embassy in China, a criminal wanted as a suspect in the January shooting of a Hong Kong businessman has already been arrested by South African police, and the belongings of the murdered person have already been retrieved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> When talking about the influence that Chinese citizens being murdered is likely to produce, Koloane believes that these events "indeed" will produce some negative effects on the trade, tourism, and other areas of exchange between the two nations; but looking at the long term, the effects "shouldn't be great." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the statements from Assistant Director of Tourism Manqoba Nyembezi of the South African Embassy, the Embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to South Africa by Chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also, according to China's official statistical data, in 2005 South Africa continued to keep China as South Africa's largest trading partner. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion USD, a year on year growth of 23%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, personnel in the tourism field believe that the Chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of Chinese going to South Africa to travel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> According to the statistics of the South African Tourism Bureau, the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 Chinese tourists travel to South Africa, a drop of 14.9% with that of the year before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> At present there are around 200,000 Chinese that live in South Africa, spread throughout South Africa's cities, towns, and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in South Africa is great, the level of unemployment high, guns are everywhere, and there is no deterrence from a death penalty; thus the crime rate is high. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not understand English but keep cash on their persons and at home, they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Censorship of Torture and Exhorted Confessions Still Key Task for Ministry of Public Safety </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 14 from Beijing (reporter Meng Nuo).  Department Head Zheng Baigang of the Police Affairs Censorship Department of the Ministry of Public Safety (MPS) pointed out when responding to the questions of foreign reporters at a MPS news conference that the so called situation of "using unsuitable methods to make suspects admit crimes" in China is definitely not permitted. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The focal point of the work of the censorship department is to prevent the occurrences of these problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He also pointed out that among some international organizations, the understanding of the situation of law enforcement of China's police is incorrect and not comprehensive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The latest material supplied by the MPS on February 14 shows that the MPS released "Regulations for Cases of Public Safety Organizations Carrying Out Detainment" in 2002, and "Regulations on Public Safety Organizations' Suitable Use of Interrogation" in 2004, which reasonably ensures that grass-root public safety organizations will use suitable interrogation and detainment procedures that adhere to the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, to greatly further the "three controls" (that is controlling exhorted confessions under torture, controlling the abuse of police guns, and controlling the abuse of compulsory procedures); the entire nations' public safety organizations' police affairs censorship force has persisted in deeply entering into precincts, criminal police ranks, patrol police ranks, traffic police ranks, and the supervising locations of public safety and other grass-roots, first line law enforcement units and other law enforcement scenes.  They have carried out overt and covert investigations, found leaks and fixed deficiencies, given warnings, and stopped problems before they arise in the law enforcement elements concerned with the rights of personal safety of citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To completely prevent the occurrence of law enforcement problems, the Department of Police Affairs Censorship has further extended the antennas of law enforcement censorship, and enlarged supervision and inspection to the suitable use of citation procedures, interrogation, connecting to police through 110, case registration statistics,  management of valuables involved in cases, public security fine personnel, the recording of information and material on criminals' weapons and vehicles and other law enforcement elements. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 15 from Beijing (reporter Li Jiangtao)  After several days of hurried decorations, the funeral hall that Beijing University set up to remember school Academician Wang Xuan at Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall formally opened at 9:00 a.m. on February 15. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At a little past eight in the morning, the opening of the funeral hall had still not occurred, yet there were already several tens of people queued outside. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This reporter saw inside the great memorial hall of Beijing University's Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall that hanging on the walls of the great hall was a black banner: "Solemnly mourn Academician Wang Xuan." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner was a huge picture of Wang Xuan (over 10 square meters big).  He is wearing glasses, smiling slightly, and his temperament is of learned elegance. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On both sides of the portrait were several dragon cypress trees and several tens of flower wreaths lined up on each side. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Among these, the funeral couplet of one of the flower wreaths said:  "This foundational skill that glorified China began in the Qin Dynasty and matured in the Tang dynasty / he sent off lead writing implements and welcomed in electronics as a modern day Bi Sheng to draw a blueprint for his invention." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> There was soft funeral music in the hall and the atmosphere was solemn and heavy. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among those mourning Academician Wang Xuan were Beijing University leaders, teachers and students.  There were friends, colleagues, students, neighbors, and even people he did not know that had specially come. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some had fresh flowers in their hands, some held flower baskets, and every person had a small white flower pinned to his or her chest.  They slowly made their way to before the picture of Academician Wang Xuan and bowed to show their respect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many people could not help but to shed warm tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, who once was the bureau head of the State Cultural Bureau, is an old Beijing University alumni.  He told this reporter that over ten years ago when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on science and technology innovation to cadres of the provincial committee. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Academician Wang Xuan was a model for both pursuing studies and personal conduct.  He made important contributions to the nation and society and the people will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Professor Jin Ruilin of Beijing University Institute of Law was an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan's of over 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A few days ago he just got out of the hospital.  Today he insisted on coming here to say goodbye to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Mr. Jin left a message in the message book, he could not control his grief, and had to wipe away the tears flowing from his eyes several times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told reporters, the daily life of Professor Wang Xuan was extremely thrifty and simple, "When he lived in the Tongfuyuan Community, he already was a professor, and already had very high accomplishments, yet still only lived in a very small bungalow for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he moved to the Chengzeyuan Community, and lived in a 78 square meter place for over 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Beijing University gave him a 140 plus square meter apartment in Langqiying Academician Building, but he didn't want it.  He also refused a high-rise apartment that Fangzheng Mansions offered him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin remembered with great emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign nations, these nations offered him a very high salary to stay, but he always resolutely refused. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "At first he insisted on not applying to be an academician, it was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan motivated him several times that he went and filled out the form." </seg>
<seg id="22"> What leaves Mr. Jin deeply touched also includes Wang Xuan's attitude toward training young people.  "He emphasized several times that 'what successes do I have now, it's not about me, but instead should be about relying on training young people.'" </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that when he was in his 50s, Wang Xuan began to pay attention to training younger people.  He always emphasized that he must pave the road, be happy to be a ladder, and yield to younger people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "This is not easy at all for a scientist that had great accomplishments." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> This reporter learned from the Beijing News Center that from 9:00 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 p.m. on February 19, Academician Wang Xuan's funeral hall will be open to the public every day from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., allowing people from various fields to come and mourn. </seg>

At present many websites all rely on reproduced news reports from a large volume of newspapers and magazines and other media to increase their hit rates, however many have not obtained authorization, and do not pay compensation.  Department Head Wang Ziqiang of the National Copyright Administration's Department of Copyrighting stated at a news conference held at the News Office of the State Council that the information network broadcasting rights protection articles which the State Council will introduce will supply a resolution concerning the problem of payment for works reproduced on the internet,. </seg>

However, newspapers and periodicals must pay compensation for works republished.  The National Copyright Administration has set the standards for compensation for reproduced works of newspapers and periodicals specifically according to what the law stipulates. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the regulations of laws currently in effect, newspaper and periodical agencies enjoy the rights of this statutory license, but at present the Internet does not enjoy these rights. </seg>

News Official Vyacheslav Sedov of Russia's Department of Defense gave a talk to media on February 15 saying that the decision of the Georgian Parliament concerning Russia's peace keeping forces will not influence the peace keeping activities of Russian soldiers in the short term.  Russian soldiers will continue to carry out their peace keeping mission in the conflict region of South Ossetia. </seg>

<seg id="4"> He emphasized that this decision of the Georgian Parliament will cause the relations of Georgia and Russian to take another step toward deterioration. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 16 from Changchun (reporter Zhou Liquan).  After an extremely large fire occurred in Liaoyuan City's Central Hospital in Jilin Province, the accident investigation group confirmed 11 responsible.  Among those responsible, Zhang Diankun, head of a team of electricians, and three others will be prosecuted as suspects in a major accident due to negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire occurred in Liaoyuan City's largest hospital - Central Hospital, causing 39 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The area this fire reached across was over 5000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to our understanding, this is the largest fire accident in any of the nation's medical or sanitation system since the founding of new China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to investigations, the accident happened at around 4:30 p.m. that day when Liaoyuan City's Central Hospital suddenly lost electricity.  According to the circuitry design of the hospital, if the electricity goes out, the transformer breaker should automatically switch to the auxiliary breaker and continue to maintain a normal supply of electricity to the hospital.  However, at that time the electricity breaker did not automatically switch.  Zhang Diankun, head of a team of electricians, forced a power transmission without investigating the reason the electricity stopped, leading to the start of the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Also, the underground electrical cable lines giving off smoke had over ten cables that were disorderly and unsystematically tangled together.  These electrical cables should have been laid out and placed extremely orderly, and fire protection layers should have been installed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Therefore, team leader Zhao Yongchun of an electricity installation team of Liaoyuan City's Textile Company, retired cadre (high level engineer) Sun Fenglin of Liaoyuan's department of electric utilities, and retired worker of Liaoyuan's Central Hospital Jin Chengtai who continued to work after retirement will also be prosecuted as suspects in the major accident due to negligence case </seg>

<seg id="1"> CCP Organization Ministry Demands to Further Enlarge Strength of Supervision of Leading Cadres and Cadre Selection and Appointment </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 16 from Beijing.  The CCP Organization Ministry has recently published its suggestions on strengthening cadre supervision tasks. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The suggestions require all levels of the organization ministry to start out from a attitude of strict management as well as concern and care for cadres.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As to the aspect of supervision of leadership groups and leading cadres, the suggestions point out that the ministry must tirelessly grasp the education of idealism and conviction as well as anti-corruption and clean government education.  It must implement education into the training and selection of cadres and their management and supervision, lead and urge leading cadres to strengthen party spirited self-cultivation.  It must maintain establishing the party for the public, executing government for the people; and build a firm theoretical and moral front line refusing corruption and preventing against dissent. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As to carrying out discussions on appointed positions with newly elevated cadres, the ministry must put forward clear demands as to aspects of integrity and self discipline. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The ministry must urge leadership groups of all levels to maintain democratic centralism; it must establish robust agendas and rules and procedures for policy making; it must seriously carry out a political system mutually uniting group leadership and individual separation of duties and authority. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The ministry must especially grasp the supervision of the main persons in authority of leadership groups.  The organization (personnel) ministry authorities must often talk candidly with the main authorities in the next lower level leadership groups; and understand the situation of their thinking, tasks, style, and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The ministry must establish a healthy leading cadre daily management and supervision system, carry out understanding and analysis of the thinking styles of leading cadre ranks at set times, and put forward opinions and procedures to resolve problems. </seg>

<seg id="11"> As to prominent problems of leading cadres brought to light from the people, the ministry must seriously investigate and understand these problems.  For problems that really exist, it must distinguish the situation and administer criticism and education or hand over the case to relevant organizations for processing.  For those problems that constitute undisciplined or illegal activities, they should be handed over to offices that carry out discipline or maintain the law.  As to those cases were no problems are found after being investigated, the ministry should take suitable methods to bestow clarification and redemption. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time the ministry must also unite the strengthening of supervision with encouraging cadres to bravely seek out and exploit innovation, and pay attention to discovering and commending superior cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The suggestions require that all levels of the organization (personnel) ministry truly strengthen the selection and appointment tasks of party and government cadres. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The ministry must further perfect the supervision of recommendations and nominations, investigations, preliminary discussions, discussions and decisions and other links in the advancement of cadres.  It must seriously grasp the selection and use of personnel; supply effective safeguards by going to all levels of leading positions for selection of cadres that are reliable in government, skillful in their work, steadfast in their style, and are trustworthy among the people. </seg>

<seg id="7"> Bob Tsao, who was UMC chairman at the time, then publicly stated that UMC did not break any regulations of the Taiwanese authorities, UMC provided help to HeJian for the long term benefits of UMC, and if UMC did not enter the mainland market as fast as possible it would lose business opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After this, the Taiwan authorities "financial supervision and management committee" used the breaking of regulations relevant to the revealing of commercial information as an excuse to issue a fine of 3 million NT. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the UMC board of directors received the letter of resignation of Bob Tsao.  Several hours later Bob Tsao was formally sued for suspicion of breaking regulations in investing in the mainland. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Likely to End Inconclusive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 17 from Turin.  News Analysis: Pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News reporter Gao Peng and Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the Turin Olympics would likely face "the specter of jail;" however, looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this Winter Olympics, Russian biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva, will not likely face jail-time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Turin Olympic Committee revealed the first stimulant scandal of the games on February 16.  It was discovered that Olga Pyleva used the prohibited stimulant Carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had already been expelled from the Winter Olympics, and the gold medal she won in the women's biathlon 15 km individual race at this Winter Olympics had already been stripped from her. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The International Biathlon Union passed a punitive decision to ban Pyleva from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has always been that the International Olympic Committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the Olympic Games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away, but they would not receive the punishment of the law. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, according to Italian law, athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates.  Those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Last December, the International Olympic Committee and the Italian Government concluded "negotiations" that had lasted as long as a year, finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to Italian Law at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> After the tireless efforts of the International Olympic Committee, Italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics, promising that during the Winter Olympics police would not enter the Olympic village and search the residences of athletes.  However, athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by Italian authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Reports state that Mario Pescante, the official supervising the Turin Olympics for the Italian government, has already handed over the Pyleva stimulant incident to Turin investigating authorities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the International Olympic Committee and Pescante have not confirmed this as of present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian team doctor for the biathlon team Andrey Dmytriev revealed on February 17 that Pyleva had already left Turin and returned to Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Chinese Sports Official Shi Liancheng, who worked for many years at the world anti-stimulant organization, believes that as soon as Pyleva returns to Russia, this incident's ending will likely be "inconclusive." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Liancheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant problems at the Winter Olympics, and although the Italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play, the results are hard to predict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in Italy, the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than "two years of suspended imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Therefore, senior reporter Pieri of Italy's Ansa News expressed that the likelihood of Pyleva going to prison is "extremely small," and at most a fine will be given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Pieri expressed that although Italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present, Italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring Pyleva back for punishment. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, then Italy will have no way to get her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Romania in Eastern Europe has already seen nine bird flu epidemic outbreaks this year.  Experts of the WHO said on February 17 in Bucharest that virtually all areas of the delta region of the Danube River have bird flu, and this situation must be dealt with seriously.  Romania is expected to be threatened by the bird flu for the next 3 to 5 years. </seg>
