</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London's Daily Express noted that two laptops with inquiry data on the 1997 Paris car accident that caused the death of Princess Diana were stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report pointed out that the theft triggered speculation that the computers may contain confidential information of the probe led by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said that there was no sensitive information or any data linked to the probe in the computers. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Norway, a peace process mediator, said that Sri Lanka's warring groups agreed to hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on the 22nd of this month, breaking a three-year deadlock in negotiations by the various parties to end decades of bloody ethnic conflicts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The breakthrough was achieved after Norway's peace envoy Solheim met in London with negotiator Balasingham from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Norwegian embassy here said in a statement, "The parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka, namely, the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have asked the Norwegian government to assist with holding talks in Geneva during the two days of February 22-23." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The two-day talks will focus on how to strengthen a ceasefire agreement that went into effect on February 23, 2002, but has not been fully followed by both parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Norwegian embassy pointed out, "The two parties will discuss how they can improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.  This is also the first time in three years that the two parties have a face-to-face negotiation at such a high level." </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> AFP on the 16th, New York </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Acknowledged as the most likely recipient of this year's Oscar for best actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, lead actor in the movie "Capote," disclosed that he had succumbed to drugs and alcohol when he was young and reckless.  Fortunately, he then succeeded in quitting and was able to start his top flight acting career. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In an interview on US CBS news magazine 60 Minutes, Hoffman softly sighed that in such period he would truly do anything to get drugs and alcohol. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At that time he was in his early 20s.  Having just graduated from New York University's drama program, he entered into a dazzling society where each day life was so fast-paced and vertiginous that he eventually got dizzy and lost control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When he was 22, he checked into a rehab center, where he kicked his alcohol and drug abuse habits.  In his whole life, that was the period of time when he felt most panicked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the upcoming Oscar Awards ceremony to be held next month, the movie "Capote," in which Hoffman's role portrays American writer Capote, is acknowledged to be the most likely winner of the best actor award. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Prior to this, his excellent acting skills have long been recognized and affirmed by several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for best actor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The 38-year-old actor said in the interview that if he had not made up his mind to kick the bad habits before he became famous, he may not have been able to win the Oscar nomination. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> AFP on the 16th, Brussels </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Panic strikes as signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The European Commission passed an additional measure to set up a "buffer zone" to fully administer the areas in countries where bird flu has been discovered, banning trade and transport of all poultry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Eight days after discovery of the pathogenic H5N1 virus in the African country of Nigeria, outbreaks continued to spread to more chicken farms, with signs indicating it has crossed the northern border into Niger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Egyptian officials are investigating a sudden incidence of mass chicken deaths on a chicken farm in the south, fearing that the virus may continue to spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With chicken markets in Europe plummeting from the impact of virus incidents, the European Commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to panic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Kyprianou, the European commissioner for health and food safety, said it is understandable that the public is concerned, but there is no need to overreact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Following an earlier measure creating three-kilometer protection zones and 10-kilometer surveillance zones around outbreaks of the virus, the European Commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a "buffer zone" in the entire region of Europe where the virus has been discovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> An EU official, who declined to be named, said that everyone is on high alert as they process from morning till night news of suspected outbreaks from around Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> So far in Europe, signs of the H5N1 virus have emerged in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Ukraine, and the European territory of Russia, among other places, almost all found on wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Romania discovered its 31st case on the 16th.  New cases were also found in Slovenia, Austria, Greece, and on the island of Ruegen in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In southern Italy, the bird flu virus was found on two ducks, the first creatures other than wild swans infected with the H5N1 virus in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> EU officials are now most worried about migratory birds which will soon return from Africa. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Nigerian government is stepping up efforts to prevent the virus on the African continent from spreading to humans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Nigerian government announced that poultry in a radius of five kilometers from affected farms, whether threatened by the virus or not, must be destroyed without exception. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The neighboring country of Niger declared a national alert and allocated 4 million US dollars to an emergency program to monitor the border with Nigeria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The newly established national emergency commission said they have received reports that nearly 400 poultry have died in Magaria, which is on the loosely guarded border between the two countries. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's New Management Rules for E-banking Operations to Take Effect on March 1 </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 6 (Correspondents Han Jie and Xu Bo) On the 6th, reporters learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission that the Measures for Administration of E-banking Business and the Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking issued recently by the CBRC will take effect on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A CBRC spokesperson said that according to the rules of the Measures for Administration, relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged, that is, after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e-banking operations, if new types of e-banking operations need to be added, the main reporting office in China for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to standardize e-banking operations of commercial banks, the People's Bank of China promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of E-banking Business in June 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The CBRC spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e-banking operations, the Interim Measures can no longer meet the requirements of e-banking risk supervision.  Therefore, the CBRC formulated these two new rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the introduction by the CBRC spokesperson, CBRC accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises.  It is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e-banking security evaluation business, but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements, even if it does not have CBRC accreditation, financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e-banking security evaluation, though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Measures for Administration of E-banking Business include 99 articles under nine chapters, with the nine sections covering general provisions, applications and amendments, risk management, administration of data exchange and transfer, outsourcing business, administration of transnational business, supervision and management, legal obligations, and by-laws. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking includes 57 articles under five chapters, with the five sections covering general provisions, security evaluation institutions, implementation of security evaluations, administration of security evaluation activities, and by-laws. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Selected Excerpts from Newspapers and Magazines) Shanghai: Moonlighters and College Graduates Become Main Hourly Workforce </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 7   The Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th.  The number of job positions reached 120, 11 more than the previous time, while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to estimates by relevant experts at the Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau, currently the number of hourly workers in Shanghai has exceeded 1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a China Youth Daily report, the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters, accounting for 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In general, moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work.  For instance, among translation-related jobs, the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7%, while it has reached 61.6% for people in fitness professions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand.  Most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, a human resources manager in a company, spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field.  Of course, the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent, they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs.  Some 14% of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "At first I didn't want to be an hourly worker.  Yet after working for a few months, I feel it is better than working from 9 to 5." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Xiao Huang, whose job after college was not satisfying, eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am quite satisfied with my current job.  It pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too.  What I need to do now is find a few more hourly positions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job-seeking graduates to accumulate work experience, practice work skills, enhance communication skills, and increase exposure to society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge-based and more technically focused positions.  For instance, specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly jobs require few skills, such as food salespeople and inventory workers.  Laid-off workers can start work right after minimal training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Statistics show that among hourly workers, 39% were previously laid-off workers.  Among them, the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4%, while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7%.  Hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Anhui should grasp firmly the great opportunity to boost development in the central region, to adhere persistently and unswervingly to the central focus of economic construction, to earnestly implement the Central Committee guidelines and policies in close connection with the actual conditions of Anhui, to innovatively carry out work, and to apply scientific development viewpoints to specific measures and implement them in actual work. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It should summarize actual experiences in a timely way, rely fully on the masses, and vigorously support reforms and innovations so as to continuously open up new prospects for work in Anhui. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Wu Bangguo stressed that China has arrived at a historic phase in which we must rely more on increasing independent creativity and enhancing the quality of the workforce to push forward social and economic development, and that only through vigorously promoting scientific advancement and innovation can we realize the qualitative enhancement of production forces and effectively push economic and social development into the trajectory of scientific development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We should establish and perfect as soon as possible a systematic mechanism conducive to innovation, increase scientific and technological input, encourage patented inventions, develop famous brand-names, accelerate the transformation of scientific research achievements into actual productivity, reinforce the dominant position of companies in independent innovation, and continuously increase the contribution rate of scientific and technological advancements to economic growth. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We should support and encourage the inclusion of technical elements in distribution, establish and perfect a statistical index system that reflects independent innovation capabilities, study and formulate finance, tax, and government procurement policies that support independent innovation, and form a political system that encourages independent innovation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We should foster social consciousness toward innovation, vigorously advocate a brave innovative and competitive spirit, and focus on creating a good environment for people of talent to come forth in large numbers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Wu Bangguo noted that the NPC is playing an increasingly large role in pushing forth governance of the State by law and construction of a socialist country by the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to carry out NPC work under new situations, first, we should adhere to the correct political direction, resolutely stay on the road of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, and organically integrate adherence to the Party leadership, the status of people as masters, and the governance of the State by law. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Second, in initiating work, we should closely embrace the overall plan of the Party and the State, closely embrace the major issues of reform, development, and stability, and closely embrace hot and tough issues that are of general concern to the people, so as to continuously enhance the actual effects of NPC work. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Third, we should put forth the special features and advantages of NPC work, adhere to centralized democracy, carry out tasks in strict accordance with laws and procedures, and decide on issues collectively. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We should adhere to the line of the masses, be people-oriented, empower the people, empathize with the people, and work for the well-being of the people. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The four major research programs cover the study of protein, the study of quantum control, the research of nanotechnology, and the study of growth and reproduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Guideline pointed out that the science of protein is currently the point of keen competition in life science by developed nations. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China will give priority to research on transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and structural biology, which are major components of biology system, the biological function and interaction of protein, protein-related computational biology and system biology, methodology of protein studies and related basic application research, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the Guideline thinks that the study of quantum control is significantly forward-looking in nature and may cast imponderable impacts on humankind's social and economic development in 20 to 30 years. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China will give priority to research on the principles and methods of carrier and control in quantum communication, quantum computation, new quantum effects of bonded small quantum systems, new principles and technology platforms for the characterization and measurement of quantum control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In addition, the Guideline points out that nanotechnology, which has become a strategic option for many countries to enhance their core competitiveness, is also one of the fields where China is expected to make breakthroughs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China's focus of research in this field will include controlled manufacturing, self-assembly and functionalization of nanomaterials, nanoelectronics, nanobiology, nanomedicine, nanoscale characterization and metrology, as well as the application of nanomaterial and nanotechnology in energy, environment, information, medicine and other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> China has a large population growth.  As many people suffer birth defects, with organs for transplant in seriously short supply, and with the upcoming arrival of an aging era, there is an urgent need for breakthroughs in the scientific theory of reproduction and growth as well as technological innovations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the Guideline, from 2006-2020, China will give priority to the research on the proliferation, differentiation, and control of stem cells, on the creation, maturity, and fertilization of reproductive cells, on the mechanism for degeneration of human reproductive function and retrogressive changes, and on assisted fertility, and the safety and ethics of stem cell technology, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Experts: US Playing up "China Military Threat" is Groundless Accusation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 9 (Correspondents Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review that the US Pentagon has officially submitted to Congress recently, China was for the first time called "an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts think this is a groundless accusation against China's normal national defense construction.  It plays up "China military threat" and interferes in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guideline document. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The 92-page-long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on China's military issues and the countermeasures the United States should take.  Directly mentioning the two phrases of "China" or "Chinese" 15 times, the report said that "as a major and emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States.  If the United States does not have countermeasures, China will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy US advantages in conventional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences, said that though senior US officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier, this is the first time the United States proposed in its "national defense strategy report" that "China is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "The report for the first time explicitly refers to Russia, India and China as emerging strategic rivals; in particular, more attention was given to the so-called 'China military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow with the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Noticeably, on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress, with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the additional budget for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the US national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars, an all time high," Peng Guangqian said. "That is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guanqian thinks that the fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflected the Pentagon's habitual style of "making enemies" and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge US arms industry groups can fish for more profits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the United States, China's national defense expenditures are quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on China's national defense, said that China's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s, but the proportion it takes in the State national budget for the same period is on the decline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official statistics show that compared with 1979, the proportion of China's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the State budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005 China's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion RMB, only about 1/14 of that of the United States.  Its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the United States, and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a US soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The United States is equal to China in terms of territorial area, but there is such a big difference in military expenditures.  It is self-evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, director of the research department of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said that the United States should evaluate China's military construction situation objectively and that China's peaceful development doesn't necessarily mean that China and the United States will become military antagonists in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> China's 2004 white paper on national defense says that China firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China has never threatened any country in the past and at present, and will never do so in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> So far China has not set up any military base in any other country, nor has China dispatched a single soldier to other countries.  In contrast, the United States has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in Asia alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Zhu Feng, a professor of the International Relations Institute of Peking University, said that China and the United States should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the China-US constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Ram Allah, Feb. 9 (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency Correspondents Wang Hao and Huang Min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) won the Legislative Council elections, how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What new policies Hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the meantime, resistance by the US and Israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the Hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, various parties in Palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (Subtitle) Who Will Become Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between "Prime Minister Hamas" and current top leader Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that the new Palestinian government led and formed by Hamas will not recognize Israel.  This strong message also increased international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The US and Israel explicitly said that they would not accept a Hamas government which possesses actual power, threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this did not hinder Hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment, selecting an independent individual as a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, in order to obtain maximum international recognition, Hamas leaders both at home and abroad, who recently gathered in Egypt, decided to select independent Jamal al-Khudairi, board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza, as new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestinian analyst Hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister, the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard-line stance of Hamas.  Only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Subtitle) How to Divide Power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Internally, the biggest challenge Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An article carried in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam analyzed that although Hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs, it lacks experience in governance.  It would be wise for it to cooperate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience in governance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Following the elections, Hamas proposed establishing a "political partnership" with Fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government.  However, Fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet.  One faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move, while another faction rejects the Hamas invitation, preferring to be an "active opposition" in the Legislative Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Sources noted that under Abbas's persuasion, Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In spite of this, Hamas and Fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In addition, another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the Legislative Council, breaking away from partisan affiliations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts, but the specific name list is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Based on US and Israeli attitudes, forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to the provisions of the Palestinian Basic Law, after the new Legislative Council assumes power on the 16th of this month, the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Subtitle) What About Arms? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The weapons it possesses is another tough issue Hamas faces in forming the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The US and Israel are very firm in their positions, resolutely demanding that Hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The issue of weapons actually exists on two levels, the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the Legislative Council through democratic and free methods.  The way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction Az A-Din Al-Qassam Brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a "People's Army" of the Palestinian National Authority, yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (Jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At present, Palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel, most of whom come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions, such as al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the Fatah Hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must reach a consensus with Abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to local media reports, Abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces, while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the Interior Ministry of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue, with no outcome so far. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 10 (Correspondent Li Jianmin)  The State Oceanic Administration has recently released the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration.  This is the first time such reports have ever been released since China began its scientific polar expedition activities more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Report gives a comprehensive account of China's polar exploration activities, polar logistics assurance, and major progresses and achievements made in polar scientific research in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the records of the Report, at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing time), the Chinese Antarctic Inland Icecap Expedition team successfully reached Dome A area, the highest elevation of the Antarctic Inland Icecap, and at 3:15 on January. 18, 2005 (Beijing time) confirmed the highest elevation point of Dome A was 4,093 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the stage of increasingly competitive international polar expedition, the Chinese, relying on their strong willpower and fearless spirit, were courageous to open up new fields and took the lead to challenge the 'peak of the Antarctic Icecap.'  Their single-stroke success realized another dream of human beings in Antarctica." </seg>
<seg id="6"> SOA Director Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Report shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic expedition team successfully finished its mission and returned to Shanghai.  The expedition lasted 151 days on a journey of 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic expedition team left Shanghai for the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific exploration, and it will leave the Zhongshan Station for Shanghai by way of Australia before the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since it was the first report on polar exploration China released, the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration also reviewed and summarized China's polar exploration that started in the early 1980s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the Report, in 1983, China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty and became a member country of the organization.  In addition, China successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on Antarctic affairs, including the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Report noted that after more than 20 years, China's polar exploration "has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale," forming a "three stations, one vessel" system on Antarctica and Arctic exploration, namely, the Changcheng Station in the Antarctic established in February 1985 and the Zhongshan Station in the Antarctic established in February 1989, and the Huanghe Station built in July 2004 in the Arctic, as well as the "Xuelong" polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for Antarctic and Arctic exploration since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The statistics in the Report show that by the end of 2005, China had organized 22 Antarctic expeditions, two Arctic expeditions based on the "Xuelong" vessel, and another two Arctic expeditions at the Huanghe Station.  To date, more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by Chinese people nationwide to the Antarctica and Arctic for up close and on-site exploration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third Antarctica scientific station and also China's first inland station at the Antarctic." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After more than 20 years' endeavors, China has got a niche in polar exploration in the world.  However, compared with other major polar exploration countries, there is still a relatively large gap.  We must catch up with them." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Fok Kin-ning, Hutchison's Group managing director, said that although "3 Italia" has now received all relevant regulatory approvals required to list, it would be in too much a hurry because the procedures for share subscription must be completed in the next few weeks. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Considering the best interests of shareholders, it has been decided that the IPO be deferred. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As to when share subscription will start again for the IPO, Fok Kin-ning said it would depend on the future conditions of the European telecommunications market. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Yongon, Feb. 12 (Correspondent Zhang Yunfei) In a special interview with reporters of this agency on the eve of Myanmar Prime Minister Soe Win's visit to China on the 14th, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Guan Mu and Commercial Attache Tang Hai said that at present China-Myanmar economic and trade Relations have showed positive momentum of common development featuring rich content, a great variety of forms, and mutual benefit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Ambassador Guan Mu said that in recent years the neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been solidified and developed.  Exchange and cooperation in various fields are increasingly expanding and deepening while bilateral economic and trade relations continue to be promoted and strengthened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Attache Tang Hai said that continued reciprocal visits at high level of the two countries have vigorously promoted the development of the bilateral economic and trade cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="5"> During the bilateral high-level reciprocal visits in 2004, the two sides signed 33 economic and trade cooperation agreement documents.  Most of them are now being implemented and carried out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He said that it was 1.14 billion US dollars in 2004 and reached 1.209 billion US dollars in 2005.  Of the total, China's exports were 935 million US dollars, while its imports stood at 274 million US dollars. </seg>

The main projects China has been contracted to do in Myanmar include power stations, bridges, harbors, and factories (such as sugar plants, textile plants, cement plants, and paper pulp plants), etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As Chinese companies carry out their engineering projects in Myanmar, they have also stimulated the export of various sets of mechanical and electronics products by China.  Myanmar has become one of the major markets for China's equipment sets, and mechanical and electronics products. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to the statistics by China's Customs, in the recent five or six years, the export volume of mechanical and electronics products has accounted for some 45% of China's total exports to Myanmar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Attache Tang also said that Myanmar is rich in natural resources.  Chinese companies have already started to invest in resource development projects in Myanmar's oil, natural gas, nickel and copper mining, etc.  The potential for the development of China-Myanmar economic and trade cooperation is tremendous. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He hopes that Chinese companies will have a long-term vision, learn to avoid risks, and make careful decisions.  They should set up a good corporate image and win honor to their country by ensuring the quality and timely completion of their awarded contract projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Ambassador Guan Mu and Attache Tang Hai both think that Prime Minister Soe Win's upcoming official visit to China, a major event in bilateral relations this year, will be of great significance in increasing mutual political trust, promoting bilateral cooperation, and pushing for further development of neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Feb. 13 (Correspondent Qian Zheng) Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of bio-artificial kidney, which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but also the function of preserving useful substances.  In addition it is small in size and easy to transplant.  With further research, there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a recent Nikkei Business Daily report, the newly-developed bio-artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts, an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine, such as water and amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Both the "artificial nephron" and the "artificial renal tubule" are made of hollow fibers.  In addition, the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis-related amyloidosis, a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis, into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose, vitamins, and minerals the body needs. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In contrast, previous artificial kidneys, depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste, were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers tested the bio-artificial kidney transplant on goats, using a pig's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are presently developing a bio-artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Safe Power Production in China Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondent An Bei) A senior official from the State Electricity Regulatory Commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005, safe power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At the fifth (expanded) meeting of the National Commission for Safe Power Production held here, SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said that in 2005 China's power production safety was generally stable, while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished.  Active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters, and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured.  Accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year-on-year basis, and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly-built power generator units added in succession, safe power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Included in these challenges are: regional, seasonal, and periodic power shortages will continue to exist; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems, while at the same time, the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control, with the situation remaining grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform, many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge.  How to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With regard to power production safety work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation, this year the SERC will carry out revision and improvement of the Provisional Regulations on Investigation of Power Production Accidents that were issued.  Meanwhile, supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005, electricity consumption by all sectors in China reached 2,468.9 gigawatt-hours, up 13.45% year-on-year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand, and increasing problems with coal, electricity, and oil transportation, various power producers took effective measures, stepping up management of infrastructure.  In all of last year, throughout the country, no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 grid accidents, down 127 cases year-on-year, and 427 infrastructure accidents, down 132 cases year-on-year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondents Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin) Minister Plenipotentiary Vusi B. Koloane, charge d'affaires ad interim of the South African embassy in China, said in an exclusive Xinhua interview on the 13th that there are no "organized" crimes against Chinese citizens in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At the same time, he said that the South African government will try its best to "crack down on all forms of criminal activity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce to zero" the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in South Africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since 2006, four Chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in South Africa.  Chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In response to this, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has made representations to South Africa and also reminded Chinese citizens in South Africa to further step up vigilance, enhance unity and friendship among Chinese compatriots, and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi B. Koloane said: "We apologize for this and assure the Chinese people that the South African government is earnestly investigating every single case involving Chinese nationals." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully cracked the February 5 case in which Chen Jianqing, a Chinese woman from Fujian, China, was killed in South Africa.  A suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At present police are after another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, according to the disclosure by the South African embassy in China, the criminal involved in the shooting of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year has been arrested by South African police, with the property of the victim recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Speaking of the impact that these incidents of Chinese citizens being killed may have, Vusi B. Koloane thinks that the incidents "indeed" will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade, tourism, and other fields between the two countries, but the impact "should be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the briefing by Nyembezi, tourism attache of the South African embassy, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals going to South Africa in the first 15 days alone of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, according to the Chinese official statistics, South Africa continued to maintain its position as China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion US dollars, growing 23% year-on-year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, tourism professionals think that the serial killings of Chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> According to the statistics of South Africa's tourism bureau, the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331, a 14.9% year-on-year decrease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Currently, some 200,000 Chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor, high unemployment rate, rampant use of guns, and lack of death penalty in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As many Chinese nationals do not understand English and have cash with them or in their homes, they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 14 (Correspondent Meng Na) While answering foreign correspondents' questions at a press conference held by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th, Zheng Baigang, deputy director of the Ministry's supervision department, pointed out that the so-called "use of inappropriate methods to make criminal suspects confess" is absolutely prohibited in China. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition, preventing such problems from happening is a major focus of work for the supervision department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He also noted that some international organizations do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of the situation of law enforcement by Chinese police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The latest data provided by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th reveal that in 2002 and 2004 the Ministry of Public Security successively issued the Provisions on the Implementation of Detention Measures and Record-keeping by Public Security Organs and the Provisions on Application of Further Interrogation by Public Security Organs, which have more effectively ensured that grass-roots public security organs carry out detention and interrogation measures in accordance with applicable laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, in order to further push for the "three rectifications" (namely, rectify the extraction of confessions by torture, rectify the abuse of arms and police equipment, and rectify the abuse of coercive measures) police supervisory personnel of public security organs nationwide have been persistently making open and secret trips to grass-roots and frontline law enforcement units such as police stations, criminal police teams, police patrol teams, traffic police teams, venues under the surveillance of public security organs, as well as scenes of law enforcement, to observe components of law enforcement involving citizens' personal safety rights, to check for holes and remedy oversights, to give warnings and reminders, and to stop wrongdoings at the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In order to prevent law enforcement problems where they originate, police supervisory departments have further broadened the scope of law enforcement supervision and stepped up supervision and inspection of components of law enforcement, such as the application of subpoena measures, inquiries and interrogations, 110 police call processing, statistics on case filings, disposal of assets involved in cases, security officers who ticket fines and penalties, and data recording of automobile thefts and robberies. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Peking University Sets Up Mourning Hall in Memory of Academician Wang Xuan </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Li Jiangtao) After a few days of intensive arrangements, a mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Memorial Hall at Peking University officially opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th.  As of the noon this day, hundreds of people have come to pay their respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Some time after 8:00 a.m., a long line of dozens of people formed outside the door before the opening time of the mourning hall. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Inside the mourning hall at PKU's Centennial Hall, this reporter saw a black banner hanging from the wall of the hall which read "Deep Condolences for Academician Wang Xuan." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Beneath the banner was a huge 10-plus square meter portrait of Wang Xuan.  Wearing a pair of glasses, he looked scholarly with a gentle smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The portrait was flanked by several cypress trees and dozens of wreaths. </seg>
<seg id="7"> One of the wreaths had this elegiac couplet: "Originated in the Qin, thriving in the Tang, a good foundation was laid in China; bidding farewell to lead type, ushering in electronic type, the modern Bi Sheng drew up the blueprint." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The mourning hall was ensconced in funereal music in a solemn and heavy atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among the mourners were leaders, teachers, and students from PKU as well as Wang Xuan's friends, colleagues, students, and neighbors.  In addition, many people not acquainted with him at all also made special effort to come. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some of them held fresh flowers in their arms, while some carried flower baskets.  All had small white flowers pinned on their chests.  Slowly they walked up to the portrait of academician Wang Xuan and bowed to express their condolences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many people could not hold back tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and a PKU alumnus, told reporters that more than ten years ago, when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation to provincial Party committee cadres. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Academician Wang Xuan set a very good example for us both in character and academic discipline.  He made great contributions to the country and society.  People will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Professor Jin Ruilin from PKU Law School was Wang Xuan's old friend and neighbor for more than four decades. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Just discharged from the hospital a few days ago, he insisted on coming to say farewell to his old friend today. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As he left a message in the remembrance book, Mr. Jin could not contain his sadness and wiped away flowing tears several times with tissues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told reporters that Professor Wang lived a very simple life.  "He was already a professor with high achievements when he lived in Tongfu Garden, but he stayed in a very small flat for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he moved into Chengze Garden and stayed in a unit of about 70 or 80 square meters for more than ten years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> When PKU assigned him to a large unit of over 140 square meters in the Academician Building in Lanqiying, he did not want it.  He did not take the high-rise unit provided at Fangzheng Building either." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin recalled with deep emotion that during Wang Xuan's visits abroad, he was given great offers to stay abroad, but he resolutely refused them all. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "At first he insisted on not applying for the title of academician.  It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan's repeated pleas that he filled out the form." </seg>
<seg id="22"> What also deeply touched Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan's attitude toward young people.  "He himself emphasized many times, what can be achieved by looking at myself now, not at myself, on the contrary, I should mentor young people." </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that Wang Xuan started to focus on mentoring young people when he was in his 50s.  He constantly stressed that he wanted to pave the way for young people and that he wanted to be their stepping stone. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "It is really not easy for a scientist with great accomplishments to do this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> This reporter learned from the PKU News Center that the mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan is open to the public for people of all walks of life to pay their respects from 9:00 a.m. to 16:00 every day, starting from 9:00 on the morning of February 15 through noon on the 19th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Known as "the modern Bi Sheng," Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University, vice chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and an academician of the Third World Academy of Sciences, passed away at 11:03 on February 13 after medical treatments failed at Union Hospital in Beijing.

<seg id="1"> China to Issue Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondents Zhou Wei and Li Fei) At present, many websites rely on republishing large quantities of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their hit rates, but many are not authorized to do so and have not paid any fees.  In response to this, Wang Ziqiang, director of the copyright division of the National Copyright Administration, said at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council on the 15th that regarding the issue of paying for republishing works online, the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued by the State Council will provide the answers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the provisions of the current law, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, newspapers and magazines can use works already published in newspapers and magazines without the consent of authors while paying compensation.  The National Copyright Administration has specifically set forth the compensation standards for republishing by newspapers and magazines in accordance with the provisions of the law. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the provisions of the current law, newspaper and magazine publishers have this legal right while no such legal permission is given to the internet at this time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to the relevant legal interpretation given by the Supreme People's Court, the legal permission to republish given to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet, that is, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, small articles published in newspapers, magazines, and on the internet can be used online without permission while compensations are made. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, since the legal interpretation does not stipulate the compensation standards, in reality such works are used on the internet without being given any compensations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Whether the legal permission is applicable to these published short works used on the internet still needs to be confirmed legally." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether it will be included into the scope set forth by the law still needs to be confirmed by the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued this year." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Song Shiyi) Sedov, an official from the Russian Defense Ministry's press service, said in his speech to the media on the 15th that the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force will not affect the peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops in the short term and that the Russian troops will continue to carry out their peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Kokoshin, chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma (lower house of the parliament), noted this day in his speech about the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force that the Georgian resolution will undermine stability in the region and adversely affect Russian-Georgian ties. </seg>

<seg id="5"> He thinks that Georgia's accusation against Russia was absurd. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> The Georgian parliament passed the resolution this day, calling for the Russian peacekeeping force to stop its peacekeeping mission in South Ossetia but did not finalize the specific deadline for the withdrawal of the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The Georgian parliament called on the government to adopt proactive actions in considering the replacement of the current Russian peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone with an international peacekeeping force. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Zhou Liquan) After a massive fire disaster occurred in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, the accident investigation team ascertained 11 culprits, among whom, four people including Zhang Diankun, head of the hospital electrician team, and others will be indicted with charges of causing a major accident due to negligence. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the investigation, at about 16:30 on the day of the accident, there was a sudden power outage in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City.  According to the design of electrical circuit for the hospital, if there was a power outage, the switch of the transformer would be automatically switched to the secondary switch so as to continue providing normal power supply for the hospital.  However, the switch did not make the automatic switch at the time, yet the electrician team leader Zhang Diankun forced the power back on without checking the cause of the power outage, causing the fire disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In addition, more than ten underground cables from which smoke started to rise were tangled together in disorder when such cables should have been neatly and evenly laid out and protected with a fire shield. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16  The Central Organization Department recently issued Suggestions for Strengthening Supervision of Cadres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Suggestions call on all levels of the Organization Department to supervise cadres in the various components of training, education, inspection, examination, selection, appointment, and day-to-day management, on the basis of strict administration and benevolent protection of cadres.  They should establish to perfection supervisory working mechanism that emphasizes prevention, timely detection, and serious rectification, so as to effectively strengthen supervision over selection and appointment of leading cadres and cadres overall. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With regard to supervision of leadership teams and leading cadres, the Suggestions propose that education on ideals and beliefs, as well as anti-corruption and promotion of integrity, should be persistently carried out.  Such education should be incorporated into the training, selection, management, and supervision of cadres so as to guide and urge leading cadres to enhance cultivation of Party spirit, adhere to the Party's principle of serving public interests and people's welfare, and build up a strong ideological line of defense against corruption and degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While talking with newly-promoted cadres about their appointments, the desire for integrity and self-discipline should be made clear. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Leadership teams at all levels should be urged to adhere to democratic centralism and to establish and perfect administrative and decision making rules and procedures, so as to earnestly implement a system of collective leadership combined with individual responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Emphasis should be placed on supervision of chief officials of leadership teams.  Organization (personnel) Department heads should have regular heart-to-heart talks with chief officials of subordinate leadership teams so as to learn about their ideologies, work, and styles, among other circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Establish to perfection a day-to-day supervisory system for leading cadres, periodically engage in learning and analysis about the circumstances of ideologies and styles of leading cadres, and propose problem-solving suggestions and measures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Implement a system of warning discussions and inquiry letters for leading cadres, and engage in timely warning discussions or letters of inquiry once signs of trouble are detected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Earnestly investigate prominent problems involving leading cadres reported by ordinary people.  If problems truly exist, criticism, education, or corresponding organizational disciplinary action should be carried out, depending on individual cases.  Violators of regulations and laws should be turned over to law enforcement organs.  If investigations confirm there have been problems, appropriate methods should be taken to clean things up. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, integrate strengthening supervision with encouraging cadres to engage in bold exploration and innovation, while paying attention to discovering and praising exemplary cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Suggestions call on the Organization (personnel) Department at all levels to effectively strengthen supervision of the selection and appointment of Party and government leading cadres. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Further improve supervisory measures concerning components of cadre work such as recommendations, examinations, consultations, discussions, and decisions.  Strictly safeguard the process of personnel selection and appointment, and provide firm assurance that cadres who are politically reliable, professionally competent, impeccable in style, and worthy of public trust are selected and appointed for leading positions at various levels. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Strengthen inspection of the implementation of the cadre appointment regulations, seriously investigate and punish violations of the cadre appointment regulations, and firmly prevent inappropriate practices and corruption involving personnel appointments. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Implement a case-based supervisory and investigative system regarding serious violations of personnel appointment regulations to expand supervision and punishment. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Establish and perfect a system of accountability regarding cadre selection and appointment.

<seg id="21"> The Organization (personnel) Department must strengthen cooperation with discipline inspection organs and establish a communication system, liaison system, and accountability system with discipline inspection organs regarding Party spirit and administrative integrity of cadres, so as to enhance collective supervision. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Earnestly and effectively conduct inspection tours in cooperation with discipline inspection organs, improve inspection tour methods, perfect the inspection tour system, and enhance the quality of inspection tours. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In cooperation with auditing organs, earnestly implement an auditing system regarding financial responsibility of leading cadres. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Chen Jianxing) On the 15th, Taiwan's official economic affairs department decided to fine United Microelectronics Corp. (abbreviated as UMC), one of Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, NT$ 5 million on the grounds of "illegally providing assistance to and participating in the establishment of" mainland-based Hejian Technology Company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case of Taiwan authorities fining a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian proposed a cross-Strait economic and trade policy advocating "active management and effective opening." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to reports, officials from the "MOEA Investment Commission" said  that UMC was fined because it violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the Regulations Governing the Approval of Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the future, the "MOEA Investment Commission" will also fine former UMC Chairman Tsao Hsing-cheng and others, depending on the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The UMC case originated in February 2005 when Taiwan's prosecution and investigation departments deployed nearly a hundred personnel in raids on the residences and offices of several top UMC officials, claiming that UMC was suspected of illegally "providing funds, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Technology, its mainland investment. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Tsao Hsing-cheng, UMC chairman at the time, subsequently stated publicly that UMC had not violated any regulations of Taiwan authorities and that UMC provided assistance to Hejian Technology in the long-term interest of UMC, since UMC would lose business opportunities if it did not get into the mainland market as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following that, Taiwan's official Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$ 3 million on the grounds of violating relevant regulations concerning business information disclosures. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the UMC Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Tsao Hsing-cheng, who a few hours later was officially indicted on suspected illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> UMC, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (abbreviated as TSMC) known as Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, is a leading high-tech corporation on the island. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The series of moves by Taiwan authorities to investigate and punish UMC over the past year have attracted great attention from all sectors of society on the island. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, Feb. 17 (Zhang Yuqing and Shen Yaoqin) Recently, an infant heart transplant was successfully performed at the Cardiovascular Institute of Jinan Military District. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the 17th, this reporter saw in the intensive care unit that the infant who had the operation 51 days ago was rosy-cheeked and playing with great enthusiasm with the toys bought for him by medical staff, now that he has smoothly passed the dangerous period after surgery, with all monitoring and test indices normal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to an introduction this day by the doctor on duty, when this infant patient from a rural area of Tai'an, Shandong, was brought to the hospital by his parents, he was blue all over and had trouble breathing.  After examination, he was diagnosed with cyanotic congenital heart disease and had to undergo a heart transplant. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 17 (Correspondent Liu Zheng) With a series of four coalmine accidents each killing more than 100 people, the grim work safety situation throughout the country last year has made "prevention of frequent serous and large-scale coalmine and other accidents" the top priority of work safety efforts nationwide this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On the 17th, this reporter learned from SAWS that in order to truly prevent frequent serious and large-scale coalmine and other accidents, coalmines must be the top priority. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With regard to coalmine safety this year, SAWS will effectively carry out the following three tasks: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of controlling methane. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This year "ventilation first, mining second" will be featured in controlling methane. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If coal mines with high concentrations of methane do not implement "ventilation first, mining second," they will be ordered to immediately stop production in accordance with the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of restructuring and shutting down. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Resolutely and tightly shut down every one of the 5,243 coalmines which have been publicly announced and the other 700-plus coalmines widely reported recently. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consider shut-downs to be routine work and continuously shut down those coalmines that destroy natural resources, pollute the environment, and do not maintain safety measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Enhance basic coalmine safety administration. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Promptly rectify and halt administrative declines in a handful of large state-owned coalmines and guide small coalmines with chaotic management to set up standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In particular, emphasis should be placed on key state-owned coalmines, absolutely prohibiting production that exceeds capacity, exceeds the intensity threshold, and exceeds the established number of workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This year's work safety control targets call for a reduction of the nationwide death toll from various kinds of accidents by 3% from the previous year, with a reduction of 3.5% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths should be reduced by 5%, with a reduction of 7% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="16"> People's governments at the provincial level have all been informed of these control targets, which are being passed down to various levels for implementation at grassroots levels and in companies in all localities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that in 2005, 5,986 people died in coalmine accidents nationwide, down 0.7% year-on-year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths went up, with the death toll rising by 66.6% year-on-year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, Feb. 17 News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua Correspondents Gao Peng and Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the Turin Winter Olympics may face "prison sentences," based on various circumstances at this time, such fate is unlikely to happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, the center of the first stimulant scandal at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the 16th, the first stimulant scandal broke out at the Turin Winter Olympics when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedon, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics.  In addition, she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women's 15 km event she won at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the International Biathlon Union decided to give Pyleva a two-year ban from the competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has always been the IOC regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the Olympic Games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete, but they are not subject to legal sanctions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, under Italian law, athletes' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts.  Prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants, and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In December last year, after "bargaining" for a year, the IOC and the Italian government finally reached an agreement, under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this Winter Olympics in accordance with the Italian law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Through the untiring efforts of the IOC, the Italian side made concession four days before the Winter Olympics opened, promising that police would not enter the Olympic village to raid athletes' quarters during the Winter Olympics, but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of Italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some reports said that Pescante, an Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, has already turned over the case of Pyleva using stimulant to Turin's prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the IOC and Pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva has already left Turin for her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who formerly worked at the World Anti-Doping Agency for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns to her country, this incident may eventually "end where it is." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng said that the IOC and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympics.  Even if the Italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case, the outcome is still hard to tell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on Italy's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse, the maximum penalties violators got were only "two-year deferred imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Therefore, Piaili, a senior reporter from the Italian news agency ANSA, said that there is "little" chance that Pyleva will go to jail.  She would just face fines at maximum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Piaili also said that although the Italian court can hold a trial in absentia, the Italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch Pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, the Italian side will not be able to do anything to her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  Comprehensive reports by Xinhua correspondents abroad said that bird flu continues to spread further on the African continent. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The WHO confirmed on the 17th that birds that died from infection with bird flu virus have been found in three areas in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, the H5 strain of bird flu virus has also been discovered for the first time in France.  Europe and Africa are on high alert and stepping up epidemic prevention measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Advisor Hassan Bushra told the news media in Egypt on the 17th that dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been found in three areas of Cairo and Giza in central Egypt, and Minya in the south.  Relevant departments of the Egyptian government have already started to slaughter fowls that are suspected of being infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts noted that as Egypt is an important passageway for migratory birds in the Middle East and North Africa, it is highly likely that migratory birds may bring the bird flu virus to the country. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on the import of live poultry from abroad and stepped up inspection and quarantine practices at the ports of entry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, more than 800 chickens on a chicken farm died mysteriously in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend the import of all poultry and pork from Nigeria, where a bird flu epidemic occurred, and put a temporary stop on the trade of poultry and related products on all markets along the border between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the government of Cameroon has promptly set up an epidemic monitoring network across the country.  The Pasteur Centre in the country and the State Veterinary Laboratory are on high alert, ready to carry out testing related to the H5N1 virus at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the epidemic on the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The National Veterinary Institute in Sweden released the test results of the dead swans discovered Wednesday, which showed the Swedish swans were not infected with bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The preliminary results of tests by the Danish Veterinary Administration also show that the thirty dead swans recently found within Denmark were not infected with bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However, the agriculture department said that Denmark still cannot afford to be off guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Since this year, nine outbreaks of bird flu have occurred in Romania in eastern Europe.  WHO experts said in Bucharest on the 17th that since bird flu broke out in almost all places in the Danube Delta region, the situation must be addressed seriously as Romania may be constantly threatened by bird flu in the next three or five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the Asian country of Bangladesh, the government has taken all necessary preventive measures against bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided relevant books on bird flu prevention to relevant officials and organized domestic fowl breeders for training. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  According to a disclosure by the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province, China's first blood information and data sharing administration and control network system was officially completed and put into operation at the center recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A relevant administrator at the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said this means that from now on, citizens will be given a unique code after participating in a blood drive with any county (city or district) blood collection/supply agency in Zhejiang Province.  The next time he/she donates blood, just by inputting the relevant code, information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation history, time of the last blood donation, and whether blood can be donated this time will be instantly displayed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The administrator further explained that if, after inputting the code, the system shows an inadequate lapse of time between blood donations, the system will indicate that conditions for blood donation this time have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This way not only protects blood donors' health but also more effectively protects blood users' health and safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In addition, when blood supplies are tight, priority will be given to blood donors and their families for the use of blood.  You just have to input the valid blood donor certificate, and information about the blood donor will instantly appear.  It is extremely convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a report by Hangzhou's Today Morning Express, at present, the information system has been put into use at all 36 blood collection agencies in the province.

<p>
<seg id="2"> AFP, Brussels, 16th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe and send people into panic. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Executive Committee of the European Union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional "buffer area" controls, including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control, and forbidding all trade and transportation of poultries and bird species. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The bird flu breakouts continue to spread to more chicken farms following the eighth day since the deadly H5N1 virus was discovered in Nigeria, Africa, and tracks demonstrate that it has crossed the northern border of Nigeria and entered into Niger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Egyptian officials are investigating the sudden mass death of chickens on a chicken farm in the south, and there is concern that the virus might continue to spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Chicken meat markets in Europe are falling to a great extent because of the impact of the virus event. The Executive Committee of the European Union stressed that there is no reason to panic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Jipu Ruinuo, an executive member of the committee responsible for sanitation and food safety, said that it is understandable for people to be concerned about the event but there is no need for overreaction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Executive Committee of the European Union has issued a new regulation and listed all of the European areas where the virus has been discovered as "buffer areas" after passing a previous resolution about the establishment of a three-kilometer protection area and ten-kilometer warning area around every virus discovery spot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> An official for the European Union, who preferred to remain anonymous, pointed out that everyone is very nervous, and processing news from everywhere in Europe about suspicions of breakouts of the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Until now, the H5N1 virus has been discovered in European regions including Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Ukraine, and Russia, and has been discovered almost exclusively in groups of wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the 16th, Romania discovered its 31st epidemic case, and Slovenia, Austria, Greece, and Ruegen Island in Germany have also discovered new epidemic cases. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The bird flu virus was discovered in the bodies of two ducks in southern Italy, which are the first poultry infected with the H5N1 virus in the European region, aside from wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The greatest concern that European Union officials have is those migrant birds that will be flying back from Africa. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Nigerian government is strengthening its work to prevent the human infection of the virus on the African continent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Nigerian government announced that all poultries and bird species must be destroyed within a five-kilometer area of where an infected farm is discovered, regardless of whether they are threatened by the virus or not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The government of Niger, its neighbor country, has announced a national warning state, and made an emergency plan by providing 4 million USD to monitor the border areas with Nigeria. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The newly established National Emergency Committee stated that they have received a report that nearly 400 poultries and bird species are dead in Magaria, a loosely guarded area between the two countries. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's New Electronic Banking Business Management Regulations will be Implemented on March 1 </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6 (reporter: Han Jie and Xu Bo) Reporters learned from China's Banking Supervision Committee on the 6th that the "Electronic Banking Business Management Method" and the "Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment" issued by the Banking Supervision Committee in recent days will be implemented on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that based on the management method regulations, the approval method for foreign financial institutions is unchanged, i.e. if a branch of a foreign bank is approved to establish an online banking business and it needs to add a new service item for the online banking business, the major unit that reports to the branch in China's territory should be solely responsible for the application and review. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To normalize banking business development of commercial banks that use the Internet, the Chinese People's Bank has made and issued the "Temporary Method for Management of Online Banking Businesses" in June, 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that with the continuous development of electronic banking business at commercial banks, the Temporary Method cannot meet the requirements for electronic banking risk control anymore. Thus, the Banking Supervision Committee has made two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As the spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee introduced, the acknowledgement of the Banking Supervision Committee on qualification of a security assessment setup is different from industrial admission or administrative approval for admission qualification for enterprises, and it is not a necessary condition for an assessment setup to conduct its security assessment business for electronic banking, and it is only a reference when financial institutions select an assessment setup. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as a security assessment setup follows related conditions and requirements, even if it is not acknowledged by the Banking Supervision Committee for its qualification, financial institutions can still invite it to conduct an assessment for electronic banking security, but it should be controlled according to related regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The "Method for Management of Electronic Banking Businesses" has a total of nine chapters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts, including the General Principle, Application and Renewal, Risk Control, Data Exchange and Transfer Control, Business Contract Control, Cross-Border Business Activities Control, Supervision Control, Liabilities, and Additional Regulations, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The "Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment" has a total of five chapters and 57 articles that are divided into five parts, including the General Principle, Security Assessment Setup, Implementation of Security Assessment, Management of Security Assessment Activities, and Additional Regulations, etc. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, February 6 (reporter: Chen Ming) Lin Yixing, an overseas Chinese from Fuqing, Fujian Province, China, was wounded when he was running his bar, and was robbed by local gunmen in the early morning of February 5, South African local time. He died after unsuccessful emergency treatment at a hospital in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa, in the early morning of the 6th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As Feng Yang, the President of the Overseas Chinese Association of Freedom State Province, said, the incident occurred at a bar in Welkom, more that 130 kilometers northwest of Bloemfontein. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While Lin Yixing, the bar owner, was cleaning items under the bar counter and preparing to end that day's business, </seg>
<seg id="5"> there were still three customers at the bar at that time. One of them pulled out a pistol and rushed behind the bar to rob him. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Lin Yixing, who was more than 40 years old, wrestled with those robbers. They shot Ling Yixing one time, and then fled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Locals rushed to the scene after they heard the news, and sent Lin Yixing to the hospital for emergency treatment. Since Lin Yixing's body had "symptoms of diffuse capillary bleeding," and the bleeding could not be stopped, Lin died around 3:30 a.m. in the early morning of February 6. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Newspaper Digest) Part-Time Workers and High School Graduates Become Major Forces of Hourly-Paid Work in Shanghai </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7. The "Guidance on the Current Standard for Hourly-Paid Wages in 2006" issued by the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City on February 6, lists 120 occupations, which is 11 more than the number issued last time. The "wage levels" of the original positions are either increased or reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As an estimate made by related experts of the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City, currently the hourly-paid workers in Shanghai are more than one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As China Youth Journal reported, part-time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of hourly-paid labors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Through a direct survey of more than 8,000 hourly-paid workers, more than half of them are part-time workers, and their ratio is 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Those part-time workers are generally well educated, and mainly do more technical work. For instance, the ratio of part-time workers in the translation occupation is as high as 81.7%, and that in the gym business is 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at hourly-paid part-time jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As was learned, monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of Yuan, and it is difficult to find high-demand talents, such as simultaneous interpreters; most hourly-paid workers' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 Yuan, such as part-time financial workers, wedding ceremony managers, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> One of the important reasons for the popularity of part-time workers for hourly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For instance, Mr. Gu, who is a manager of the Human Resources Unit at a company, uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu thinks that the greatest benefit of a part-time job is to continuously renew his own knowledge, and has opportunities to know another field, and of course, a monthly income of 2,000 Yuan is also attractive to a certain extent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since some positions for hourly-paid workers are low-skill ones, and their working patterns are flexible and free, they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs. 14% of hourly-paid workers are graduates from colleges and polytechnic schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "I did not want to do an hourly-paid job in the beginning. But several months later, I feel it is better than 9 to 5 work." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Xiao Huang's job hunting is not that satisfying after he graduates from college. He eventually registers with a hotel and plays background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am quite satisfied with my current work, 100 yuan per hour, and the environment is also good. What I should do now is to find several more hourly-paid jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As has been learned, hourly-paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumulate work experience, exercise their work skills, improve their communication skills, and enrich their social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Those graduates who work at hourly-paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills, including translation positions, which require professional skills, and entertainment and performance positions, which require current popularity. These two kinds of positions are 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively, among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some positions for hourly-paid workers do not require high skills, such as food promotion workers, merchandise handlers, and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple trainings. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Data shows that those hourly-paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39% of the total hourly-paid workers; among them, workers who used to work in retail business are 68.4%; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 58.7%. The hourly-paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Wu Bangguo stressed that China has entered the historical phase in which she must rely more on strengthening her self-innovative capability and promoting labor qualities to advance economic and social developments, and that only if scientific and technological progress and innovations are vigorously advanced can quality of productivity be greatly improved, and economic and social developments actually be turned to a path of scientific development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It should establish and perfect systems and mechanisms that are good for innovations as soon as possible, enhance science and technology investment, encourage patents and inventions, develop well-known brands, accelerate the transformation from scientific and technological accomplishments to realization of productivity, strengthen enterprises' autonomy in their own innovations, and continuously promote the contribution rate of scientific and technological developments in economic growth. </seg>

<seg id="11"> It should cultivate innovative awareness in the entire society, vigorously advocate an innovative and competitive spirit, and focus on creating a good atmosphere for cultivation of talents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Wu Bangguo pointed out that the People's Congress is playing more important roles in the process of administration of the nation with laws and construction of the socialist country with legal systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For the People's Congress to do a good job in the new situation, the first thing should be to stick to a correct political direction, firmly walk on the developmental path of socialist politics with Chinese features, and organically integrate staying with the leadership of the Party, people being in charge, and governing the country according to laws. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The second thing should be to focus on the major work of the party and state, important issues in reforms and developments, and working on hot and difficult issues that the masses of people care about, and continuously strengthen the efficiency of the work of the People's Congress. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The third thing should be to fully take advantage of the features and superiority of work in the People' s Congress, stick to the democratic centralization system, do things strictly by law and procedure, and make collective decisions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Comes Up With an "Important Science and Research Plan" for Future 15 Years </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (reporter: Li Xing) To promote China's international competitive capacity, vigorously advance sustainable development, and realize a prioritized plan for surpassing (developed countries), the "Outline Plan for the State's Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development (2006 to 2020)," issued by the State Council on the 9th, has arranged four important plans for scientific studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The four important scientific plans include protein studies, quantum adjustment and control studies, nano-studies, and growth and reproduction studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The outline points out that protein science is the peak of life science that developed countries are fiercely competing for. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China should focus on studying transcription repression histochemistry, protein histochemistry, metabolic histochemistry, structural biology, functions and interactions of protein biology, biology and systematic biology regarding protein calculation, methodology of protein studies and related application and basic studies, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the outline thinks that quantum adjustment and control studies has an obvious forward-looking nature, and might significantly impact the economic development of human society to an extent that can hardly be assessed in 20 to 30 years. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China should focus on studying the carrier, adjustment, and control rationales and methods of quantum communication, quantum calculation, the new quantum effect of constrained small quantum systems, quantum adjustment and control demonstration, and a new rationale and technical basis for quantum measurement, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Moreover, the outline points out that nano-technology has become the strategic selection for many countries to promote their core competitive capacity, and also is one of the fields for China to realize its surpassing development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China will focus on studying in this field, including controllable equipment, self-assembly, and functionalization of nano-material, nano-electronics, nano-biology, nano-medicine, nano-size demonstration and metrology, and applications of nano-material and technology in fields such as energy, the environment, information, medicine, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Since China's population is growing on a large scale, there are many birth defects, a serious shortage of organs for transplants, and the aging peak is coming, it urgently needs to make breakthroughs and technological innovations in the scientific theories on reproduction and development. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Based on the outline, from 2006 to 2020, China will focus on studying stem cell reproduction, differentiation, adjustment, and control; production, maturity, and fertilization of reproductive cells; the mechanism of declination and degenerative pathological changes in human reproductive functions; and the safety and ethics of assisting reproduction of stem cells, and stem cell technology, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Experts: "China's Military Threat" Touted by the United States Is an Unreasonable Accusation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (reporters: Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, Lin Liping). The Quadrennial Defense Review formally submitted by the United States Pentagon to the Congress a few days ago first calls China "a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the United States militarily." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against China's normal defense construction, and an interference in China's internal affairs by exaggerating the "theory of China's military threat." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is a new guidance document for national defense of the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This 92-page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of China's military strength and how the United States should cope with it. The report directly mentions the two terms of "China" and "Chinese" 15 times, and says that, "As a major newly arisen power, China has the most military potential to compete with the United States; if the United States does not take any countermeasures, China is very likely to develop destructive military technology, and break the US supremacy of traditional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow at the World's Military Study Office of China's Military Science Academy, said that although senior US officials expressed similar views before, this is the first time for the United States to come up with the idea that "China is most likely to challenge the United States militarily as a newly arisen power" in a Defense Strategy Report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "This report first regards Russia, India, and China as newly arisen strategic rivals, and especially, pays more attention to the so-called 'theory of China's military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow at China's Military Science Academy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The noticeable thing is that on the same day when The Quadrennial Defense Review was submitted, US President Bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the Congress, and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the budget for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the defense budget for the US in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars," said Peng Guangqian. "And this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian thinks that the US method of making "theories of threats from other countries" reflects its consistent style of "making enemies," and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the US's gigantic defense industry groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the US, China's military expenditure is quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated in the writing of the China Defense White Paper many times, said that since the 90s of the 20th century, with the economic development, China's defense funding has been increased to some extent, but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state's financial expenditure in the same periods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979, the ratio of China's defense expenditure in the state's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> China's defense funding in 2005 was RMB 244.656 billion Yuan, which only amounts to 1/14 of that of the US; military expense per capita is only equal to 1/60 of that of the US; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1/30 of that of the US Armed Forces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The US land area is about as big as China's, but the gap in military expenditures between (the two countries) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> said Peng Guangqian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, Director of the Study Office at China's Armament Control and Disarmament Association, said that the US side should objectively comment on China's military construction, and China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the United States will become military rivals in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> China's Defense White Paper 2004 says that China firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> China has never established any military bases in any other countries so far, nor sent any troops to other countries; but the United States has established more than a hundred overseas military bases, and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the Asian region alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Zhu Feng, a professor at the International Relations College of Beijing University, said that both China and the United States should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust, thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between China and the United States in the new century, and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, February 9 (reporter: Ding Ying and Yan Tao). The mystery of the opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympic Games will be formally unveiled at Turin Olympic Stadium at 8 p.m. on the 10th, local time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Organization Committee of the Turin Winter Olympic Games disclosed the splendid arrangement for the opening ceremony to reporters in advance on the 9th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Chair of the Organization Committee Castellani is very confident about the opening ceremony. He said in a press conference that the opening ceremony has cost around ten million Euros and gathered top Italian talents from every field. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He said that the evening of the 10th will be unforgettable, when 35,000 audience members in the stadium and around 2 billion TV viewers around the world will watch "the very inspiring and successful opening ceremony." </seg>

<seg id="1"> (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Organization of its Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Ramallah, February 9 (International Observation). Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Organization of its Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency reporters: Wang Hao and Huang Min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the Legislative Committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kind of a new policy Hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the boycott attitude of the United States and Israel has made the prospect of the Hamas government more uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently, all the parties in Palestine are consulting each other tensely, and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subtitle) Who Will be Selected to Take the Position of Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Some outsiders worry that a "Hamas Prime Minister" might have disagreements with Abbas, the current supreme leader, after Hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Moreover, a Hamas leader, Mushir, who is visiting Egypt, stressed that a new Palestinian government established by Hamas leadership will not acknowledge Israel. This strong signal has also raised more international concerns. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The United States and Israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a Hamas government that controls real power, and threatened to stop their economic aid to Palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the Palestinian side. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, these things do not hinder Hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly. Selection of an independent candidate is one compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As it has been reported, to win maximum acknowledgement internationally, the Hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in Egypt a few days ago, had decided to select Jamal al-Khudairi, an independent person who is the Chair of the Board of Gaza Islamic University, to be the new Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This move has not been responded to by related parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Hussein, a Palestinian analyst, said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister, the most important thing is to soften the "strong" attitude of Hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister, and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Subtitle) How to Allocate Power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The biggest challenge for Hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An article published by the Palestinian Daily Journal analyzed that although Hamas has won support from people through social welfare items, it lacks administrative experience, and a better strategy is to collaborate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has administrative experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hamas suggested to establish a "political partnership" with Fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election, but Fatah has not actively responded to it so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Inside Fatah, there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it; some refuse the invitation from Hamas and would rather become an "active opposition" in the Legislative Committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A well-informed source pointed out that Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after Abbas's persuasion. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even so, Fatah will bargain with Hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the Legislative Committee and free of partisan leanings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As it has been reported, Hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government, but the concrete name list of the government is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Because of the attitude of the United States and Israel, a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to regulations of the Palestinian "Essential Law," nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new Legislative Committee assumes office on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Subtitle) Where does the Armed Wing go? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The attitude of the United States and Israel is very strong, and they firmly request that Hamas give up violence, and refuse its joining the government with its weapons. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mushir stressed on the 9th that the armed resistance is the "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the Legislative Committee through a democratic and free method, and the legitimatized path for its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, is to integrate it into a security organization for the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a "People's Army" under the Palestinian National Authority, but it has not received broad responses, and has even been criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Organization (Jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations, and most of them come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Moreover, Fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them, such as the "Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades" and "Fatah Hawks," etc. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, responsible for the cabinet organization, must make an agreement with Abbas on how to control those self-governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As local media reported, Abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the Internal Affairs Ministry of a new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue, and have not produced any results. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10 (reporter: Li Jianmin). The China's Polar-Region Exploration Report 2005 issued by the State Ocean Bureau of China is the first published one since China started its polar region scientific exploration activities more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The report thoroughly reflects the major developments and accomplishments of China's scientific exploration activities, exploration logistic support, and scientific studies in the polar regions in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Based on the record of the report, China's Antarctic Inland Ice Cover Exploration Team successfully climbed to the A area of the peak of the ice mountain where the top of the inland ice cover at the South Pole was above sea level at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing Time), and determined that the highest spot of Ice Mountain A was 4,093 meters at 3:15 on January 18 (Beijing Time). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the stage of international polar-region exploration, where competition is becoming increasingly fierce, the Chinese resort to their strong will and fearless spirit, bravely exploring the new field and successfully first climbing the 'highest point of ice cover at the South Pole' with one move, and making one more dream of mankind come true at the South Pole." </seg>
<seg id="6"> Sun Zhihui, the head of the State Ocean Bureau, said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report demonstrates that the 21st Antarctic Exploration Team of China accomplished its tasks completely and returned to Shanghai on March 24, 2005. The exploration lasted 151 days, and its total voyage was 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd South Pole Exploration Team left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station at the South Pole to conduct scientific exploration activities, and would leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai through Australia before the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since it is the first time for China to issue the polar-region exploration report, China's Polar-Region Exploration Report 2005 also traces back and summarizes China's polar-region exploration efforts, which started in the 80s of the 20th century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the report, China formally joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983, and became a member country of the Antarctic Treaty, and a consulting member country of the Antarctic Treaty, and a member country of those most influential international organizations of South Pole affairs, respectively, including the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Antarctic Bureau President Council. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee, and won its speaking right and decision-making right in international polar-region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The report points out that in more than 20 years, China's polar-region explorations have been developed from nothing to having something, and advanced continuously into an initial size. A scientific and exploration system for the South and North Poles, including "three stations and one ship," has been formed, i.e. the Antarctic Great Wall Station established in February 1985; Zhongshan Antarctic Station established in February 1989; the Arctic Huanghe Station established in July 2004, and the "Snow Dragon" polar-region exploration ship that has assumed exploration tasks in the Antarctic and Arctic since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Based on the statistics in the report, China has organized 22 scientific explorations, 2 scientific explorations in the Arctic by using the "Snow Dragon" ship as a carrier platform in the Arctic, and 2 batches of explorations around the Arctic Huanghe Station by the end of 2005. There have been more than 3,000 person times of team members nationwide so far who have been in the Antarctic or Arctic to do field explorations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "Currently, we are doing investigation work for the feasibility of building the third exploration station in the Antarctic, that is also China's first inland exploration station in the Antarctic," </seg>
<seg id="15"> said Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Through more than 20 years' efforts, China's polar-region exploration cause has played a role in the world's polar-region explorations. But compared with those major countries of polar-region explorations, there is still a bigger gap (between China and them), and we must catch up with them," </seg>
<seg id="17"> he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will publish a polar-region exploration report every year in the future. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 13 (reporter: Qian Zheng). Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of manmade biological kidney that can not only function the same as a human kidney for catabolism, but can also keep useful substances in the body. Since it is small in size and easy to transplant, it is hopeful that it will bring good news to patients who have kidney disease with the further development of the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As Japan Economic and Industrial News reported a few days ago, the newly developed manmade biological kidney is composed of two parts. One is the "manmade nephron," which filters metabolites and water in the blood; the other is the "manmade urinary tubules," which extract useful substances such as water and amino acids from the original urine and sends them back into the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Both the "manmade nephron" and "manmade urinary tubules" are made of hollow threads, and the internal walls of the "manmade urinary tubules" are paved with epithelial cells of urinary tubules that have the function of catabolism. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This type of epithelial cells can treat diseases caused by repeated hemodialysis and decompose the causative substance of "dialysis-related denatured starch" into an amino acid, and send it back into the blood. They can also send those substances necessary for the human body such as glucose, vitamins, and minerals back into the blood again. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Previous manmade kidneys depended on the osmosis pressure gap of dialysis to filter metabolites, which cannot totally get rid of them, and does not have the function of making amino acids and other substances return into the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers used goats to do the manmade kidney transplant experiment, and the inner walls of hollow threads of the manmade kidney are lined with epithelial cells from a hog. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the manmade kidney is able to function. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Secure Power Production Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13 (reporter: An Pei). A leader of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee said on the 13th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005, secure power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Vice Chairman of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee Shi Yubo said at the Fifth (expanded) Session of the National Secure Power Production Committee that in 2005 China's secure power production was stable in general, and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the summertime, realized a secure power supply, actively coped with the strikes of natural disasters, and basically assured the secure and stable operation of power systems, greatly reduced equipment accidents in secure power production and general power network accidents, compared with those of last year, and the health level of power equipment was increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations, and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another, secure power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include: regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortages still exist; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed, supply of power and coal is still quite problematic; at the same time, the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled, and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets; some power network structures are fragile and their equipment is obsolete, which brings risks to systems' safety; frequent occurrences of accidents in power infrastructure construction have not completely changed, and the situation is still serious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the further development of power system reform, many deep-rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed, and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the secure power production work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perfected to strengthen responsive capabilities for emergencies; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened; security of big dams should be assured; safety control of power facility constructions should be strengthened to reduce occurrences of personnel injury and death accidents; information delivery work should be continuously strengthened to assure the accurate, timely, and smooth flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation, this year the Power Supervision and Control Committee will revise and perfect the issued Temporary Regulations on Accident Investigation of Power Production, and at the same time will continuously issue and execute additional documents about the safety of the hydraulic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005, the whole of Chinese society used a total power of 2468.9 billion KWh, and increased 13.45% compared with that of last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Facing the situation in which power supply and demand is still tense, and the unfavorable status of transportation problems with coal, power, and oil, power enterprises have taken effective measures and strengthened equipment control, and prevented the occurrence of large equipment accidents in national power production in all of last year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 power network accidents, which were reduced by 127 compared with those of last year; equipment accidents were 427, which were reduced by 132 compared with those of last year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Minister of South Africa, in China, Says There Are No "Organized" Criminal Activities against Chinese Citizens in South Africa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13 (reporters: Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin). Charge d'Affaires ad interim and Minister of the South African Embassy in China Vusi Bruce Koloane said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 13th that there are no "organized" criminal activities against Chinese citizens in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said at the same time that the South African government will make every effort to "strike against all forms of criminal activities." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi Bruce Koloane stated that the South African government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero," and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in South Africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since 2006, 4 Chinese citizens have been killed, one after another, in South Africa, and the Chinese world has broadly paid attention to it. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Foreign Ministry has contacted the South African side about the matter, and warned Chinese citizens who are traveling in South Africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection, and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas Chinese, and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi Bruce Koloane said, "We are sorry for this, and we also want the Chinese people to believe that the South African government is carefully investigating every case related to the Chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As the embassy of South Africa presented, the South African police have successfully broken a case in which Chen Jianqing, a woman came from Fujian, China, was killed on February 5 in South Africa, and have arrested a suspect. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The police are searching for another suspect at present. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As the South African embassy in China disclosed, the suspect, who is charged with the gun death of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year, has been arrested by the South African police, and the belongings of the victim have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> When talking about the possible impacts of the killings of Chinese citizens, Vusi Bruce Koloane thinks that those incidents will "indeed" impact trade, tourism, and exchanges in other fields between the two countries, and produce negative outcomes. But in the long run, those impacts "should not be big." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As Tourist Attache of the South African embassy Nian Beixi presented, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for Chinese to go to South Africa in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Based on the statistical data of the Chinese government, South Africa had maintained its number one status as China's biggest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion USD, and increased 23% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing Chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Based on the statistics of the Sightseeing Bureau of South Africa, there were 20,331 Chinese tourists who visited South Africa in the first half of 2005, which were reduced 14.9% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> There are about 200,000 Chinese who live in South Africa at present, and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in South African society, and a high unemployment rate, guns are spread everywhere, and no death penalty, the crime rate is still high there. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not speak English, and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes, they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, to further promote the "three corrections" (i.e. corrections of forcing confessions by torture, abuse of guns and equipment by the police, and abuse of coercive measures), the public security's police affairs supervision and investigation forces have gone into grass-roots and front law enforcement units including street police stations, police teams, police patrol teams, police traffic teams, and supervision and control sites of public security units, to enforce laws on site. They have investigated law enforcement links publicly that involve citizens' personal security and rights, and made private visits for them in order to look for oversights and errors by law enforcement units, and to remind and warn them to avoid mistakes from the beginning. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (reporter: Li Jiangtao). Through several days of tense arrangements, the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan that was set up at the Memorial of the Hundred-Year Anniversary of Peking University was formally opened at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 15th. By noon of that day, several hundred people had come and offered their condolences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Before the mourning hall's opening time, about 8 a.m. that morning, several dozen people had waited in a long line outside the hall's gate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Inside the memorial hall, the reporter saw the dark, horizontal banner with the calligraphy "Express Profound Condolences over Academician Wang Xuan" hanging on the wall of the Memorial of the Hundred-Year Anniversary of Peking University. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner, there was a big picture of Wang Xuan that was more than ten square meters in size. Wang was wearing a pair of glasses, smiling with a scholarly air. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Several cypress trees and several dozen wreaths were put along both sides of the picture. </seg>
<seg id="7"> An elegiac couplet on a wreath was written like this: "It began in the Qin Dynasty, prospered in the Tang Dynasty, glorified China, and skillfully laid a foundation; the contemporary Bi Sheng said farewell to the lead age, greeted the electronic one, and drew a blueprint." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Low-volume funeral music was mingled in the mourning hall, in a solemn and respectful atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among groups who came to express their condolences, there were leaders, teachers, students of Peking University, and friends, colleagues, students, neighbors of Academician Wang Xuan, and also, many strangers who did not know him. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some of them held fresh flowers in their hands; some carried flower baskets; everybody, wearing small white flowers on their chests, slowly walked to the picture of Academician Wang Xuan, and bowed to express their condolences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many could not help but weep warm tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, who was the Director of the State's Cultural Relic Bureau and an old alumnus of Peking University, told the reporter that, more than ten years ago, when he worked in Henan Province, he invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation for cadres of the provincial Party Committee. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "The conduct and academic studies of Academician Wang Xuan are the model for us to learn. He made important contributions for the country and society, and people will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Jin Ruilin, a professor at Peking University's Law School, has been an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan for more than 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He just left the hospital several days ago, and insisted on coming today to say farewell to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Mr. Jin wrote his words in the visitors' book, he could not help but sadden and wipe the tears pouring from his eyes many times with tissues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told the reporter that Professor Wang Xuan lived a very simple life, "when he lived in Tongfu Yuan, he had already been a professor and had accomplished significant achievements. But he still lived in a very small one-level house for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He later moved to Chengze Yuan, where he had a space of 70 to 80 square meters, and lived there for more than ten years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He refused an offer when Peking University provided him a big 140-square-meter flat in the Academician Building located in Lan Qiying; he also refused an upper-floor flat provided by Fangzheng Building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin recalled and said with deep emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign countries, he simply refused to take positions with very good offers provided by foreign institutions. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "He insisted on not applying for the title of Academician at the beginning; then he gave up and filled out an application only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan went to get him moving him many times." </seg>
<seg id="22"> Another thing that moved Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan's attitude toward the training of young people, "he himself stressed many times that what should be found and relied on are not what achievements I have achieved, not myself, but the training of young people." </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that when Wang Xuan was around more than 50 years old, he started to pay attention to cultivating young people. He had stressed that we should pave a path, be willing to become a human ladder, and make way for young people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "It is not easy at all for a very accomplished scientist to do this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The reporter learned from the Peking University news center that the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan will open to the public for people coming from various circles to express their condolences from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day from 9 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 noon on February 19. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China to Implement Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (reporters: Zhou Wei and Li Fei). Many networks and websites currently rely on republishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their click rates, but many of them are neither authorized, nor pay related fees. To cope with this, Director of the Copyright Department of the State Copyright Bureau Wang Ziqiang said in a press conference, held by the News Office of the State Council on the 15th, that the State Council will explain about the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks, on the issue of paying for republishing works on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to existing laws and regulations, regarding those works published in newspapers, as long as their authors did not state that "they cannot be used," newspapers can use those works without their authors' permission, but at the same time should pay them, and the State Copyright Bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper reprint practices according to the law. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to regulations in existing laws, newspapers have the right to such legal permissions, but the Internet currently does not have rights for such legal permissions. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to related interpretations made by the People's Supreme Court, the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the Internet, i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the Internet, whose authors did not state that "they cannot be used," the Internet can use them without permission, but at the same time needs to pay their authors. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard, the Internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Regarding whether the Internet use of published small or short works applies to the legal permission, it still needs to be determined according to the laws." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether it will be included in a category of law depends on the confirmation of the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks this year." </seg>

<seg id="1"> (International) Russian Military Says Georgian Parliament's Resolution Will Not Affect Russia's Peacekeeping Activities </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15 (reporter: Song Shiyi). Xie Duofu, a news officer for the Russian Defense Ministry, told the media on the 15th that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia's peacekeeping troops will not affect the Russian military's peacekeeping activities in the short term, and Russian troops will continue to fulfill their peacekeeping mission in the conflict area of South Ossetia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Chair of the Russian Independent State Affairs Committee of the State Duma (lower house of the parliament), Kokoshin, made a speech and indicated regarding the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia's peacekeeping troops, on the same day the resolution was published, that the resolution will harm the stability of the situation in that area and negatively impact the relations between Russia and Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He stressed that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament is a further bad step toward damaging the relations between Russia and Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He thinks that the Georgian accusation against the Russian side is absurd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Georgian Parliament passed the resolution on that day, and requested Russia's peacekeeping troops to stop their peacekeeping activities in South Ossetia, but did not set a concrete deadline for Russia's peacekeeping troops to withdraw. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Georgian Parliament accuses Russia's peacekeeping personnel of a failure to fulfill their designated obligation, and regards the actions taken by Russia in the conflict area as "trying to annex Georgian territory." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Georgian Parliament requests the Georgian government to take an active action and consider inviting international peacekeeping troops - to be stationed in the conflict area of South Ossetia - to replace the peacekeeping activities currently undertaken by Russia in that area. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Georgian Parliament also requests the government to revise a related agreement that determined the stationing of Russia's peacekeeping personnel in the conflict area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> South Ossetia is an autonomous Georgian state, and borders with Russia's Republic of North Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It announced its own independence after the Soviet Union collapsed, and has been confronting Georgia's central government for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia currently has a peacekeeping battalion of 500 soldiers stationed in that area. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The troops stationed there are based on the agreement signed by four parties - including Russia, Georgia, North Ossetia, and South Ossetia - in 1992. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 16 (reporter: Zhou Liquan). After the large fire disaster occurred at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City in Jilin Province, an accident investigation group determined that 11 individuals are responsible, and among them, the head of the electrician team of the hospital, Zhang Diankun, and three other persons will be prosecuted as liable for the big accident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Central Hospital, the largest one in Liaoyuan City, experienced a big fire on December 15, 2005, which eventually took 39 lives. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The total burned area in this fire disaster was more than 5,000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As it has been learned, this is the biggest fire accident in the national medical and health system since New China was established. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As was investigated, at around 16:30 on the day the accident occurred, there was a sudden power failure at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City. Based on the hospital's electrical circuit design, if there is a power failure, the circuit breaker in the transformer box should automatically switch to a backup socket to maintain normal power supply for the hospital. But at that time the circuit breaker did not automatically switch to the socket. Zhang Diankun, the head of the technician team, forced the power supply without investigating and clarifying the cause of the power failure, and caused the fire disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Those smoky underground cables, which should be laid out on a flat surface in very good order, were tangled together without any order, and fire prevention layers should be set up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Thus, three individuals including Zhao Yongchun, the 57-year-old head of the electrical equipment installation team of the Textile Company of Liaoyuan City, Sun Fenglin, a retired cadre (senior engineer) from the Liaoyuan Power Affairs Bureau, and Jin Taicheng, a reemployed retiree worker at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, will be prosecuted as suspects in the liability for the big accident. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Central Organization Department of CCP Requires Further Strengthening of Supervision Work for Selection and Appointment of Leaders and Cadres </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16. The Central Organization Department recently printed and issued a suggestion regarding strengthening the supervision work for cadres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The suggestion requires that Party organization departments at every level should strictly control, care for, and protect cadres, and conduct supervision work for cadres at every stage of cadres' cultivation and education, review and test, selection and appointment, and routine management, and establish, perfect, and strengthen prevention work, promptly discover problems in the supervision work mechanism, seriously correct them, and truly strengthen the supervision work for selection and appointment of leaders and cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The suggestion points out that the primary tasks of the organization departments for cadre supervision include, first, supervision of the leadership team and leaders, and its priority is to strengthen supervision of the major leader of a leadership team; second, supervision of the selection and appointment work of leaders of the Party and administrations, and its priority is to supervise and review implementation of the Working Regulation on Selection and Appointment of leaders of the Party and Administrations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With regards to the supervision of the leadership team and leaders, the suggestion proposes that the ideal and good-faith education and anti-corruption and honesty promotion education should be consistently adhered to, and those educations should be practiced in cultivation, selection, control, and supervision of cadres, guide and urge leaders to strengthen their training of the Party spirit, and stick to strengthening the ideological and ethical frontline, emphasizing that the Party is established for the public, the administration is for the people, and anti-corruption is to prevent degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Honesty and self-discipline should clearly come up as requirements when talking with newly promoted cadres in their appointment meetings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Leadership teams at every level should be urged to stick to the democratic centralization system, establish and perfect rules and procedures for meetings and decision-making, and carefully practice the system that integrates collective leadership with individual responsibility in related fields. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supervision over the major leader of a leadership team should be emphasized. Leaders of organization (personnel) departments should frequently talk with and conduct heart-to-heart talks with the major leader of a leadership team at the next lower level to learn the status of his ideology, work, and style of work, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A routine control and supervision system should be established and perfected for leaders; the status of ideology and style of work of a leadership team should be regularly learned and analyzed, and suggestions and measures should be come up with to solve problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A warning talk and letter inquiry system for leaders should be practiced. Once the hint of a problem emerges, a warning talk or letter inquiry should be promptly conducted. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As for those obvious problems with leaders reported by the masses, they should be carefully investigated and clarified; if a problem is true, the leader concerned should be criticized and educated, or disciplined by appropriate organizational measures; if any leader violates any regulation or law, he or she should be transferred to the law or discipline enforcement organization to be investigated; if a leader is found innocent through an investigation, a clarification should be addressed for him or her in a proper manner. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, strengthening supervision of cadres should be integrated by encouraging cadres to boldly explore and develop innovations, and excellent cadres should be discovered and promptly commended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Suggestion requires that organization (personnel) departments at every level should truly strengthen the supervision work of selection and appointment of leaders of the Party and administrations. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Supervision measures on the stages of cadres' recommendation, nomination, test and review, discussion, and determination, etc., should be further perfected, and cadres should be strictly selected and used, and vigorous support should be provided for recommendation and selection of cadres who are politically reliable, talented at their work, maintain a good style of work, and are trusted by the masses of people to take leadership positions at every level. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The implementation status of the regulations for cadre appointment should be reviewed vigorously. Any conduct that violates the regulations for cadre appointment should be seriously investigated and disciplined, and indecent practices and corruption in the use of cadres should be firmly contained. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A supervision and investigation system for any serious violation of regulations for the use of cadres should be practiced to further strengthen supervision, investigation, and disciplinary work. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A system of selection and appointment of cadres - and investigation of their working responsibility - should be established and perfected. Based on the principle that power matches responsibility, every stage of the cadres' selection and appointment work, including the main body of responsibility and content of responsibility, should be scientifically defined, and an investigation method should be clarified to strengthen investigation work. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The supervision role played by the masses should be fully exercised to establish and perfect a reporting mechanism that is "convenient, secure, and highly efficient." </seg>
<seg id="19"> The supervision role played by public opinion should be fully employed, and the status of cadres' selection and appointment work should be notified to the news media within an appropriate amount of time, and accept the supervision of public opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The suggestion proposes that a coordination mechanism of cadre supervision work should be further perfected. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Organization (personnel) departments should strengthen coordination with discipline investigation organizations, establish a work communication system, contact person system, and responsibility system, with discipline investigation organizations in the aspect of cadres' fair administration and their Party spirit, in order to strengthen integrated supervision. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Visiting and investigation work should be carefully and well done with discipline investigation organizations; visiting and investigating methods can be improved and perfected to promote visiting and investigation quality. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An auditing system for leaders' economic responsibility should be carefully practiced with auditing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> An internal supervision mechanism for cadres' selection and appointment work of the organization departments should be perfected. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16 (reporter: Chen Jianxing). On the 15th, an economic affairs administration of the Taiwan authorities decided to fine Lianhua Electronics Corporation (shortened name: "Liandian"), one of "the two giant wafer producers" in Taiwan, 5 million New Taiwan Dollars, because it "violates regulation by providing assistance and participating in creation" for Hejian Science and Technology Company on the Mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case used by Taiwanese authorities to fine and discipline a Taiwanese business that invested on the Mainland since Chen Shui-bian came up with the economic and trade policy of "actively controlling and effectively opening." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As has been reported, a person from the Taiwan "Report and Review Committee of the Economic Department" said that the reason why Liandian was fined was because it violated "the Regulation of the People's Relation across the Strait," and regulations of "Permission Methods for Investment and Technological Cooperation on the Mainland." </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the future, the Report and Review Committee will fine Tsao Hsing-cheng, former Chair of the Board of Liandian, according to the circumstances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "Liandian Case" originated in February 2005, and by then Taiwanese investigation departments had used around a hundred people to hurriedly search the residences and offices of several high-level Liandian employees, and alleged that Liandian was suspected of investing on the Mainland and "illegally providing capital, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Science and Technology Company. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Tsao Hsing-cheng, the then-Chair of the Liandian Board, later publicly stated that Liandian did not violate any of the Taiwan authorities' regulations, and the assistance Liandian provided to Hejian Science and Technology was for Liandian's long-term interest, and Liandian would lose business opportunities if it did not enter the Mainland market as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After that, the "Financial Supervision and Control Committee" of the Taiwan authorities fined Liandian 3 million New Taiwan Dollars for its violation of the regulation regarding disclosure of commercial information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the Liandian Board accepted Tsao Hsing-cheng's resignation, and he was formally prosecuted for violation of regulations on investment on the Mainland within several hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Liandian and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (shortened name: TSMC) are called "the two giant wafer producers" in Taiwan, and both are leading high-tech enterprises on the island. </seg>

<seg id="1"> State Safety Supervision Bureau: Containment of Frequently-Occurring Large and Major Accidents in Coal Mines is Top of This Year's Priorities </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17 (reporter: Liu Zheng). Since four large mine accidents - in each of which around a hundred miners lost their lives - have continuously occurred, the serious situation of national safe production in the past year has caused "containment of frequently-occurring large and major accidents in coal mines" to become the highest among national safety supervision work priorities for this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The reporter learned from the State's Supervision and Control Bureau of Safe Production on the 17th that for the purpose of truly containing large and major accidents frequently occurring in coal or other mines, coal mines are the highest among priorities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The State's Supervision and Control Bureau of Safe Production will focus on the following three things for coal mine safety this year: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to effectively fight for gas control. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Extraction first and collection later" should be the priority for gas control this year. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If a shaft that has dense gas does not practice the method of "extraction first and collection later," it should be ordered by law to stop production immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to effectively fight for consolidation and closure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Those 5,243 shafts announced to the public, and more than 700 coal mine shafts recently reported from many local areas, should be completely and truly shut down. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Closure should be regarded as a regular activity, and those coal mines that damage resources, pollute the environment, and lack safe conditions, should be continuously shut down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Strengthen basic control of coal mine safety. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Immediately correct and stop losing management in a few big state-owned mines, and guide small mines that have mismanagement in establishing standard safety and management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Especially, major state-owned coal mines should be paid more attention to, and any productions exceeding their capacities, intensities, and fixed number of employees should never be allowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The controlled percentages for safe production for this year require the number of deaths in various accidents nationwide to be decreased 3% compared with that of last year, and among them, the number in coal mines to be decreased 3.5%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The number of large accidents that cause more than ten deaths each should be decreased by 5%, and among them, the number in coal mines should be decreased 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These controlled percentages have been announced to every provincial people's government, and local administrations are dividing them in terms of different levels and allocating them to grass-roots and businesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that there were 5,986 victims in coal mine accidents nationwide in 2005, and the number was 0.7% lower compared with that of last year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, large accidents that had more than ten victims each have increased, and the number of victims has increased 66.6% compared with that of last year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympic Games: Stimulant) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, February 17. News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency Reporters: Gao Peng, Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the "disaster of being jailed," many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to Russian women's biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva, who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the Winter Olympic Games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The first stimulant use scandal at the Turin Winter Olympic Games was exposed on the 16th, and Olga Pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been thrown out of the Winter Olympic Games, and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women's biathlon had been withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, the International Winter Biathlon Alliance determined to forbid Pyleva to participate in the sport for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The International Olympic Committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants, they will lose their qualification to participate in the Games, and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn, but they are not subject to legal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, according to Italian law, the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities. A law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants. Any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The International Olympic Committee had been "bargaining" with the Italian government for one year, and eventually reached an agreement last December. Both sides agreed that during the period of the Winter Olympic Games, any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to Italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Through the unremitting efforts made by the International Olympic Committee, the Italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympic Games, and promised that the police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athlete residences during the Olympic Games. But any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by Italian prosecution organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some reports said that Pescante, an official of the Italian government responsible for supervision of the Turin Winter Olympic Games, has transferred Pyleva's stimulant case to a Turin prosecution organization. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the International Olympic Committee and Pescante himself have not confirmed this so far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Andrey Dmytriev, a doctor for the Russian Biathlon Team ,disclosed at noontime on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin and returned home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who had been in a position at the World Anti-Stimulant Organization for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns home, this case might eventually "be settled by leaving it unsettled." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have not "completely addressed" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympic Games, and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if Italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on past penalty cases in which Italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants, the most serious penalty was merely a "two-year probation." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus, senior reporter Piali from the Italian ANSA said that the possibility of Pyleva being jailed is "very small," and at most, she might be fined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Piali also said that although an Italian court could sentence her by default, it is impossible for the Italian police to catch Pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the sentence, the Italian side can do nothing about it. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18. A comprehensive report by Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad: Bird flu is further spread on the African continent. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The World Health Organization confirmed on the 17th that birds have been found dead of infections by the bird flu virus in three areas of Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, France also first discovered the H5 bird flu virus; Europe and Africa are on high alert and strengthening prevention measures against the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Hussein Bushila, a consultant for the Eastern Mediterranean region of the WHO, told press in Egypt on the 17th that three areas in Egypt - including Cairo and Jizah in the central region, and Minya in the southern region - have found birds dead of H5N1 bird flu virus infection; Egyptian government departments have started to kill poultries suspected of being infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts pointed out that Egypt is an important passage for migrant birds in the Middle East and North Africa. The possibility of migrant birds bringing bird flu virus across borders is very high. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on import of any live poultries from foreign countries, and strengthened quarantine work at border ports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> More than 800 chickens died of unknown causes on a chicken farm in the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde, in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend imports of all poultries and pork from Nigeria, where the bird flu epidemic was discovered, and discontinued trade of poultries and related products in markets in border areas between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Cameroonian government has also established a monitoring and detection network that can cover its overall territories for epidemic detection. Its Bayside Center and the State Veterinary Laboratory are also under an emergency status so that they can deploy any test work associated with the H5N1 virus at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden initially excluded the epidemic on the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Swedish Veterinary Institute issued a test result that shows the dead swans found in Sweden this Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> An initial test result done by the Danish State Veterinary Control Bureau also showed that the 30 dead swans found in Danish territories in recent days were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But an agricultural department stated that Denmark still cannot lower its guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> 9 bird flu epidemic spots have been discovered in Romania in Eastern Europe this year. WHO experts in Bucharest said on the 17th that bird flu has spread to almost every area of the Delta Region of the Danube River, and the situation must be carefully coped with, and Romania might be continuously threatened by bird flu within 3 to 5 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Bangladesh in Asia, the government has taken every measure necessary to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Poultry Service Bureau has provided related officials books about prevention of bird flu, and also simultaneously organized poultry raisers for trainings. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18. As the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province disclosed, China's first blood sharing information data management and control network system has recently been formally established at the center and has been put into operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A leader involved with the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that any citizen who has freely donated his blood in any county (city, district) blood collection and supply institutions of Zhejiang Province will have a unique code record. When he donates blood again, information that determines if he is qualified to donate his blood will immediately show up as long as his code record, individual information, blood type, blood donation record, and time of last blood donation are entered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The leader further explained that if the system shows a free-blood donor is still within an interval period through entering the related code records, it will point out that the person does not meet the requirements for blood donation at this time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way it can protect not only the health of the blood donor, but also the health and safety of blood recipients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In addition, when the blood supply is in shortage, a blood donor or his relatives can have the right to use his blood first. As long as you enter a valid I.D. for the blood donor, his related information will show up, which is pretty convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As Today's Morning Journal of Hangzhou reported, the information system has currently been put into operation in 36 blood collection and supply institutions throughout the province. And the blood resources status for all of the blood collection and supply institutions in the province can also be shown in real time, which has accomplished data sharing throughout the province. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Manila, February 18. Local Philippines officials said on the 18th that 11 villages in the eastern Philippines have been hurriedly evacuated in case a similar mudslide occurs again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rosette Lerias, a Southern Leyte Province official, said on that day that those villages are located in the same area as the village where a mudslide occurred on the 17th, and the terrain features are similar. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Residents of the 11 villages who were evacuated will be placed in 7 evacuation centers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Lerias said that the government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday, and today it sent people to check those villages because some of the villagers do not want to leave their homes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The mudslide incident occurred on the 17th close to a village located beside a mountain in St. Bernard Township in the southern part of South Leyte Province. Mud and rocks had buried the entire village, and only a few roofs could be seen from TV footage. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Since mud is very thick and wet, there is almost no hope for buried humans to survive. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At present, 109 people have been found dead and 57 people have been rescued. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As has been estimated, the number of deaths caused by the incident may be as high as 1,800. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London, the 6th (AFP) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London's Daily Express has reported that two laptop computers containing material on the probe into Princess Diana's fatal car crash in Paris in 1997 have been stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report says the theft has given rise to conjecture that the computers may contain confidential material from the investigation headed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the computers did not contain any sensitive information or any material linked to the probe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Lord Stevens is the chief constable of Northumbria Police in England. His office is located in Newcastle upon Tyne. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said detectives with the Northumbria Police have been investigating two burglaries in the last ten days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The first took place on the weekend of January 28 to 29 when the computers and cash were taken. The second burglary took place last week, but without any loss. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Northumbria Police also said there was no evidence that the two break-ins were linked to Lord Stevens' work. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Stevens has been investigating if the princess of Wales' death was not the result of a straightforward car accident. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 2004, Royal Coroner Burgess ordered further investigation into related evidence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Princess Diana died in a car crash in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997. Her lover, Fayed, and a chauffeur were also killed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A two-year investigation by French police concluded that the tragedy resulted because the chauffeur, who was drunk and taking prescription drugs, was driving too fast and lost control. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The unrelenting advance of bird flu across Europe is causing anxiety among the public. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The European Commission (EC) approved the establishment of "buffer zones" which would cover entire areas of infected countries and in which trade and transport of poultry products would be prohibited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In Africa, where the lethal H5N1 strain of the virus was discovered eight days ago in Nigeria, the disease has continued spread to more poultry farms and showed signs of having crossed the northern border into Niger. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Following provisions for three-kilometer protection zones and ten-kilometer surveillance zones around virus outbreak points, the European Commission also issued a regulation that will turn entire regions where the virus is found into "buffer zones". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Han Jie, Xu Bo) Reporters were informed on the 6th by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that two rules recently issued by the CBRC--the Electronic Banking Administration Measures and the Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide--will take effect on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A CBRC spokesman said that according to provisions of the Administration Measures, the examination and authorization method for foreign-capital financial institutions remains essentially unchanged. Namely, if foreign bank branches that have already been authorized to open online banking services need to add additional online banking products, their primary reporting bank must submit a consolidated application. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> , In June 2001, the China People's Bank promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Banking Operations to standardize use of the Internet by commercial banks in developing banking services. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A CBRC spokesman said that with the continuous development of the online banking operations of commercial banks, the Interim Measures no longer answered the need for supervision and control of risks in online banking. For this reason, the CBRC enacted the two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the CBRC spokesman, the CBRC's approval of the qualifications of security assessment organizations is different from the administrative approval of qualifications for industry access or market access. It is not a prerequisite for assessment organizations developing electronic banking security assessment services, but is instead only a reference for financial institutions choosing an assessment organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Financial institutions can hire a security assessment organization to perform e-banking security assessments as long as the assessment organization complies with relevant conditions and requirements, even if its qualifications have not undergone CBRC approval. Assessments must however be supervised in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Electronic Banking Administration Measures are divided into 99 items under nine chapters covering general principles, application and change of registration, risk management, management of information exchange and transfer, supervision of out-sourcing, supervision of trans-national business, oversight and administration, legal liability and supplementary provisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide is divided into 57 items under five chapters, covering general principles, security assessment organizations, implementation of security assessments, administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions. </seg>

Despite efforts to save him, he died in the early morning of the 6th in a hospital in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to Feng Yang, president of the Free State Chinese Association, the incident occurred in a bar in the city of Welkom, 130km northwest of Bloemfontein. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the time, the bar-owner Lin Yixing was behind the bar counter tidying some articles in preparation to end the business day. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At that moment, one of the three clients that were still in the bar pulled out a gun and ran behind the counter in order to carry out a robbery. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Newspaper excerpt）Shanghai: Part-timers and University Grads Become Main Source of Hourly Workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) The Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security released on the 6th the "2006 Most Recent Guidance for Hourly Wages". It covers 120 kinds of positions--11 more than the last edition--and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to estimates by experts at the Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security, the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> China Youth Daily has reported that university graduates and part-timers are the main source of hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part-timers, with the percentage reaching 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The educational level of these part-timers is generally high, with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work, in which part-timers make up 81.7% of the manpower.  In the fitness industry, they occupy up to 61.6% of the positions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part-time work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to sources, the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply. Simultaneous interpretation is one such example. The monthly income for most hourly positions--such as part-time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony--can reach 2000 yuan or more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Another important reason that hourly part-time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one's knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, manager of an enterprise's human resources department, spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu says the greatest benefits of part-time work are the continuous upgrading of one's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field. Of course, the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements, they are gradually finding favor with many job-seeking graduates. Fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Initially, I wasn't interested in hourly work. But after a few months, I feel that it is better than a nine-to-five job." </seg>
<seg id="14"> After Young Huang graduated from university, he could not find a job he liked. Finally, he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "At 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment, I am very satisfied with my job. What I need now is to find more hourly jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to reports, hourly jobs have become an important route for job-hunting graduates to accumulate work experience, hone their work skills, improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills, such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work. These two fields account for 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly positions, such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks, do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Data shows that the unemployed make up 39% of hourly workers. The proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4% in retail-related positions and 58.7% in catering-related positions. Hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Li Xing)In a bid to increase China's international competitiveness, vigorously promote sustainable development, and realize breakthroughs in key areas, the National Guideline on Medium- and Long-Term Programs for Science and Technology Development (2006-2020) published by the State Council on the 9th lays out four areas of major scientific research. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The four major scientific programs are the study of protein, research into the control of quanta, nano research and the study of growth and reproduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The guideline says protein science is a peak of the life sciences that has developed countries energetically vying with each other. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China will give top priority to the study of the transcriptomics of major biological systems, proteomics, metabolomics, structural biology, protein's biological capabilities and other interactions, biology and system biology for protein-related calculations, methodology for protein research and basic research for related applications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The guideline also said that research into the control of quanta was clearly foresighted and that in twenty to thirty years it may have imponderable impact on mankind's social and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China must give top priority to the study of quantum information carriers as well as the principles and methods of control, quantum calculation, the effect of new quanta on limited small quanta systems, new principles and new technical foundations for the characterization and measure of quantum control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Furthermore, the guideline says nano technology has become the strategic choice of many countries for upgrading their core competitiveness and is also a realm is which China has hope of achieving great leaps in development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China's key research in the domain will include controllable preparation, self-assembly and enabling of nano-particles; nano-electronics; nano-biology and nano-medicine; nano measuring, characterization and metrics; and the use of nano particles and nano technology in various fields, including energy, environment, information, and medicine. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Experts: US Making Groundless Accusations by Playing Up "China Military Threat" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua)  (Reporters: Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review it formally submitted recently to Congress, the US Pentagon has said for the first time that China is "the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts say this is unreasonable finger-pointing at China's normal defense construction, an exaggeration of the "Chinese military threat" and an interference in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The 92-page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of China's military and the countermeasures the United States should take. The report makes 15 direct references to "China" or "Chinese" and says that "as an important emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States. If the United States fails to take countermeasures, China will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional U.S. military advantages". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, researcher with the Department of World Military Research at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, said that although senior US officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions, this is the first time that the US has said in the defense report that "China is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "It is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to Russia, India and China as rising strategic opponents and, in particular, focused more on the so-called 'Chinese military threat'," </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Worthy of note is that on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress. It included US$439.3bn earmarked for national defense. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the budget supplemented for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is included, the American national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top US$500bn to reach an all-time high," Peng Guangqian said. "This is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world's countries." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian says fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflects the Pentagon's consistent  style of "manufacturing  enemies", and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the colossal weapons industry groups of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the United States, China's national defense spending is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Military expert Deng Hongzhou, who has participated several times in the compilation of the white book on Chinese national defense, said that since the 1990s China's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed, but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall downward trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that compared with 1979, the proportion that China's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005, China's national defense expenditure was Rmb244.656bn, equal to only 1/14 that of the US; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1/60 that of the US and military expenditure per serviceman was equal to 1/30 that of the US military. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The US is about as large as China in terms of territory, but the difference in their military spending is so great. It is self-evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, director of the Research Department of the China Association of Armament Control and Disarmament, says that the US should objectively evaluate China's military construction and adds that China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the US will become military adversaries in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The 2004 China National Defense white book says that China keeps firmly to the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China is no threat to any country, either in the past, at present or in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> To date, China has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country. In contrast, the US keeps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in Asian alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Professor Zhu Feng of the College of International Relations, Beijing University says China and the US should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange, improve mutual understanding and trust, promote a constructive Sino-US partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> RAMALLAH, Feb. 9 (Xinhua)(International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Xinhua Reporters: Wang Hao, Huang Min) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Following the victory of Palestine's Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in parliamentary elections, how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kind of policies Hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the resistant attitude of the US and Israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the Hamas-lead government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, the different Palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subhead) Who Will Become Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since Hamas won the right to form a cabinet, some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the "Hamas Prime Minister" and the Palestinian leader, Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the leader of Hamas, Mashaal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that a Palestinian government formed by the leaders of Hamas would not recognize Israel, a hard-line signal that heightened international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The US and Israel have clearly stated they will not accept a Hamas-led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to Palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But this has not prevented Hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments, including a compromise policy of selecting independents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, in order to maximize recognition from the international community, in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of Hamas gathered in Egypt decided to select an independent figure, Ismail Haniyeh, chairman of the board of Gaza Islamic University, to become the new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Concerned parties have not yet responded to the move. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestinian analyst Hisham said that, whoever takes over the prime-ministership, the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down Hamas' hard-line character, since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (subhead) How will authority be distributed? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> From an internal perspective, the biggest challenge faced by the Hamas-led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An analysis in an article in the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam said that Hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office. Cooperation with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, or Fatah, will be the best solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> After the election, Hamas raise the possibility of a "political partnership" with Fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government, but until now Fatah has not given a positive response. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet. One faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway; another faction refuses the invitation by Hamas and wants instead to be "an active opposition" in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Informed sources say Fatah, with persuasion coming from Abbas, is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even so, Hamas and Fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts, but the actual name list is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In view of US and Israeli attitudes, a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Palestine's Basic Law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (subhead) How do the weapons fit in? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Hamas' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The US and Israel have an extremely hard-line attitude, insisting that Hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The leader of Hamas, Mashaal, emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the organization's "strategic choice". </seg>
<seg id="31"> The issue of weapons in reality includes two levels:  the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> That Hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally. It will, through similarly legal methods, try to integrate its armed branch, the Al-Qassam Brigade, into the government's security apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a Palestinian national force, or "People's Army", but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the Palestine Islamic Jihad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel, the vast majority of which are from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Fatah Hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Responsible for forming a cabinet, Hamas will have to come to terms with Fatah regarding how to manage these various self-governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to local media reports, Abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces. The police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Li Jianmin) China's State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has issued the 2005 China Annual Polar Exploration Report, the first of its kind since China began scientific polar exploration more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Report reflects the polar exploration activities, polar expedition logistics, and the main progress and achievements made during China's polar scientific studies in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Report records that at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing Time) the Chinese Antarctic Expedition's Inland Icecap Exploration Team successfully scaled Dome A, the highest inland icecap in Antarctica, and determined at 3:15 a.m. on January 18 (Beijing Time) that the elevation of the highest point of Dome A is 4093m. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the increasingly competitive stage of international polar investigation, Chinese took the lead in charging the 'highest point on the Antarctic icecap' and achieved success in one go by relying on their adamant will, intrepid spirit and courage to break new ground, realizing another dream for mankind in Antarctica," </seg>
<seg id="6"> said SOA Director Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Report says that on March 24, 2005, the 21st Chinese expedition to Antarctica returned to Shanghai after successfully fulfilling its mission. The expedition took 151 days and covered 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, the 22nd Chinese Antarctic expedition left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station in Antarctica, where it will carry out scientific investigation activities. It will leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai by way of Australia at the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because it is China's first polar expedition report, the 2005 China Annual Polar Exploration Report also includes a retrospective and summary of China's exploratory undertakings in the polar regions since they began in the 1980s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the Report, China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983, becoming a member country of the Antarctic Treaty Organization and other most influential international organizations for Antarctic affairs, including Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee, winning the right to speak and participate in decision-making in international polar affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Report points out that over a period of more than 20 years China's polar explorations "started from scratch, continuously developed and took on scale", now consisting of a "three stations, one vessel" system for scientific exploration in the Antarctic and Arctic; that is: the Antarctic Great Wall Station set up in February 1985, the Antarctic Zhongshan Station set up in February 1989, the Arctic Yellow River Station set up in July 2004 and "Snow Dragon" polar expedition ship that has carried out Arctic and Antarctic exploration functions since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to statistics contained in the Report, as of the end of 2005, China had organized 22 scientific Antarctic expeditions, 2 Arctic scientific expeditions using the Snow Dragon as a carrier platform and 2 Arctic expeditions at the Yellow River Station. So far, more than 3000 Chinese expeditioners have participated in field investigations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We are currently conducting research on the feasibility of a third Antarctic exploration station. This is also China's first feasibility study into an inland station in Antarctica." </seg>
<seg id="15"> said Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After more than 20 years of endeavor, China has now gained a footing in world polar exploration. However, compared to other major polar exploration countries, there still exists a large gap and we must catch up," </seg>
<seg id="17"> he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui revealed that China will issue a report on polar expeditions on an annual basis in the future. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> TOKYO, February 13 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Qian Zheng) Researchers at Tokai University in Japan have developed a bioartificial kidney. It not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components. Additionally, it is small in size and easy to transplant. As more detailed research is carried out, there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a recent report by the Japan Light Industry News, the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts. One part is composed of "artificial nephrons" that filter metabolic matter and water from blood; the other part consists of the "artificial renal tubules" the extracts water, amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread. The inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis --dialysis-related amyloidosis-- to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood. At the same time, it can also cause the glucose, vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the past, artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely. They were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats. Epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, the researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had successfully served its function. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are currently developing a bioartificial kidney that uses human kidney cells and will conduct clinical studies after its safety has been verified. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Safe Electricity Production in China Still Faced with Difficult Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua)(Reporter: An Pei) An official with the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) said on the 13th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005, it still faces difficult challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said at the Fifth (Expanded) Meeting of the National Electricity Safe Production Committee held here that China's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005, with the task of supplying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized. The impact of natural disasters was actively countered, thereby essentially ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power system. Accidents involving safe power production equipment or the general power grid showed a dramatic year-on-year reduction, while the health of power equipment was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power-generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include the following: electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region-specific, season-specific and time-specific basis; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them; at the same time, the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control, seriously affecting the stable operation of power-generating sets; the weak structure and outdated equipment of some power grids cause hidden problems in system safety; the frequent occurrence of accidents in the construction of electric power infrastructure has not been turned around and the situation remains grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system. The new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal, orderly production. </seg>

<seg id="1"> SA Envoy: No Organized Criminal Activities Against Chinese Nationals in South Africa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua)(Reporters: Wang Jiangang, Hao Yalin) Vusi B. Koloane, charge d'affaires of the South African embassy in China, said on the 13th in an exclusive interview with a Xinhua reporter that there in no organized criminal effort against Chinese nationals in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He also said the South African government would do everything possible to "fight all forms of criminal activity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero" and wants the safety of the lives and property of every foreigner working in South Africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> So far, four Chinese citizens have been murdered in South Africa in 2006, causing a widespread expression of concern from the Chinese community. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised the issue with South Africa and warned Chinese citizens traveling to South Africa to be more aware of safety precautions. It also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi B. Koloane said, "We feel sorry for what has happened and ask the Chinese people to believe that the government of South Africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving Chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully solved the case of Chen Jianqing, a woman from Fujian, China who was murdered in South Africa on February 5. One suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Police are currently hunting another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore, the South African embassy in China has revealed that South African police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a Hong Kong businessman in January this year and that the victim's possessions have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Speaking of the impact that the killing of Chinese citizens might have, Vusi B. Koloane said that the incidents would "definitely" have a negative impact on business, tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries, but the impact would "probably be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to Manqoba Nyembezi, tourism attache with the South African embassy in China, the South African embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to official Chinese statistics, South Africa continued to remain China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Bilateral trade grew 23% year-on-year to US$7.27bn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, tourism industry sources said the serial killings of Chinese citizens in South Africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Statistics from the South African Tourism Board show that 20,331 Chinese tourists visited South Africa in the first half of 2005, representing a year-on-year decrease of 14.9%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Approximately 200,000 Chinese currently live in South Africa. They are spread throughout South Africa's cities, town and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in South African society, high unemployment, the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not understand English, they keep cash on their person and in their homes, making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money. </seg>

<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)(Reporter:  Li Jiangtao) After days of intensive arrangements, the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University formally opened at 9:00 on the 15th. By noon, hundreds of people had come to pay their last respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> By just after 8:00, before the morning hall was scheduled to open, scores of people had lined up outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University, this reporter saw a black banner hanging on the wall. It read  "Profound Grieving for Academician Wang Xuan". </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner was a huge funerary portrait more than ten square meters in size. In it, he wore glasses and had a slight smile, reflecting his refined temperament. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On both sides of the funerary portrait stood several cypresses. Scores of wreaths were lined up on both sides. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) (Reporters: Zhou Wei, Li Fei) Many websites rely on large-scale retransmission of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase hits. But many have not been authorized to do so and have not paid any fees. To counter this, said Director-General of the Copyright Department of the National Copyright Administration Wang Ziqiang at a news conference held by the State Council on the 15th, the State Council's impending Information Network Transmission Right Protection Regulations will respond to the issue of fees for the transmission of Internet works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect, works already published in a newspaper or magazine, if an author fails to make a "Not for Use" declaration, magazines and newspapers can use the work without the author's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration. In accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations, the State Copyright Bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for retransmission of newspapers and magazines. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the laws and regulations currently in effect, while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization, Internet sites do not have the same right. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to a related judicial interpretation by the Supreme People's Court, the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the Internet, so that short articles published in newspapers, magazines and on the Internet can be used on the Internet without acquiring permission if the author has not made a "Do Not Use" declaration, with the user being required to pay remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards, in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "On the issue of whether legal authorization applies to the use on the Internet of short articles that have already been published, this still needs to be determined at the legal level." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether or not it is to be included within a scope determined by law, it is still necessary to wait for the Information Network Transmission Protection Regulations to be issued this year in order to make a confirmation. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> CHANGCHUN, February 16 (Xinhua) (Reporter: Zhou Liquan) Following a large fire in a hospital in the city of Liaoyuan in Jilin province, an accident investigation team has determined eleven individuals to be responsible. These include the supervisor of the electrician team, Zhang Diankun, and four other individuals who will be prosecuted for gross negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire at the largest hospital in Liaoyuan, the Central Hospital, resulted in 39 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The fire covered an area of more than 5000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to reports, it was the largest fire to occur in the national healthcare system since the foundation of new China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> An investigation has revealed that the incident began on that day at approximately 1630hrs when electricity to the Liaoyuan Central Hospital suddenly stopped. According to the hospital's circuitry design, if power is cut, the switch in the transformer box automatically activates a backup switch that maintains the normal supply of power to the hospital. In this case, the backup switch failed to automatically activate and Electrician Team Supervisor Zhang Diankun forced the resumption of power without checking the cause of the outage. This resulted in the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Furthermore, there were more than ten cables that were tangled together among the underground electrical cables that were giving off smoke. This kind of electrical cable should be neatly arranged and a fire protection layer should be installed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, three other individual will also be prosecuted for gross negligence: 57-year-old Zhao Yongchun, electrical installation team supervisor at the Liaoyuan Textile Company; Sun Fenglin, a retired official (senior engineer) for the Liaoyuan Electricity Bureau; and Jin Chengtai, retired employee of the Liaoyuan Central Hospital who was later rehired. </seg>

<seg id="11"> carefully investigate prominent problems regarding leading cadres reported by the masses; those who indeed have problems should be subject to criticism, education or relevant organizational treatment according to the seriousness of the case; those who have broken discipline and laws should be turned over to the law enforcement authorities; when no problem is found following investigation, clarification should be made in a suitable manner. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, it is necessary to combine the supervision of cadres with motivating cadres to boldly explore, blaze new trails and innovate. Attention should be paid to the discovery and commendation of outstanding cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The opinions call on the organization (personnel) department at all levels to practically strengthen supervision of the selection and appointment of leading cadres in the Party and government; </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Chen Jianxing) The economic administration authorities of the Taiwan government decided on the 15th to fine United Microelectronics Corporations (UMC)--one of the "two titans of Taiwan's chip industry"--NT$5 million for "unlawfully aiding and participating in the establishment" of He Jian Technology in mainland China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first time Taiwan authorities have penalized a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian came up with a stance of advocating a cross-strait economic policy of "active management, effective liberalization". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the report, individuals attached to the Investment Commission of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said UMC was fined because it had violated the Statute Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area as well as the Measures Governing Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Investment Commission will fine UMC's former chairman Tsao Hsing-Cheng and others after reviewing the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "UMC Case" began in February, 2005, when Taiwanese investigators sent nearly a hundred people to raid the homes and offices of several UMC executives, saying UMC was suspected of "illegally providing funds, technology and human resources" to Hejian Technology, a mainland company in which UMC had invested. </seg>
<seg id="7"> UMC's chairman at the time, Tsao Hsing-Cheng, publicly stated after the event that UMC had not breached any of the Taiwan government's regulations and that UMC's help to Hejian Technology was in UMC's long-term interest because UMC would lose business opportunities if it failed to quickly enter the mainland market. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Afterwards, the Taiwan government's Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$3 million for contravening regulations on the disclosure of business information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> UMC's board accepted Tsao Hsing-Cheng's resignation on January 9, 2006. A few hours later, Tsao Hsing-Cheng was officially indicted for alleged illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> UMC and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), which have been called the "two titans of Taiwan's chip industry", are the island's hi-tech giants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A series of investigations into UMC by Taiwanese authorities have been closely watched by all sectors of society on the island. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> JINAN, February 17 (Xinhua)(Zhang Yuqing, Shen Yaoqin) Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute recently performed successful heart transplant surgery on an infant. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th, reporters saw that the infant's face was plump and red 51 days after the surgery and all monitoring and prognostic indicators were normal. He had smoothly passed through the critical period of the surgery and was now cheerfully playing with toys bought for him by hospital staff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The doctor examining him that day explained that when the sick infant from the rural district of Tai'An in Shandong was brought to the hospital by his parents, his entire body was blue and purple and he was having difficulty breathing. Following a medical examination, he was diagnosed as suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease that would require a heart transplant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Heart transplant surgery is the most difficult, risky and complicated of all heart surgeries. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is especially true when it involves a heart transplant in an infant under one year old, something that had never been done in China. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute organized specialists who  deliberated into the night, meticulously designing a surgical and post-operative-monitoring plan. They devised innovations of their own in the method of vascular anastomosis and carried out tests on animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At 8:00 a.m. on December 28, 2005, the surgery officially began. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The donor heart came from an infant that had died after sudden respiratory-and-heart failure caused by a congenital lung malformation. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The surgery required the anastomosis of six arteries and more than 510 sutures, with the distance between sutures not exceeding 3mm. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After 295 minutes, the surgery was a complete success. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Liu Zheng) Following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people, the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made "curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents" the most urgent task in national work safety this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This reporter was informed on the 17th by the State Administration of Work Safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> To make coal mines safer this year, the State Administration of Work Safety will take a strong hold over the following three items: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Control of gas this year must give prominence to "draining gas before mining coal". </seg>
<seg id="7"> If high gassy mines fail to "drain gas before mining coal", they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The 5243 coal-mine and coal-pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one, as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Closures must become a part of routine work, with coal mines that destroy resources, pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Strengthen administration of coal-mine safety infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The deterioration of management in the small number of large state-owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled, while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In particular, key state-owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity, strength or manpower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3% drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents, including a 3.5% drop in accidents in coal mines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5%, while in the coal mines they must decrease 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These control standards have been transmitted to the people's governments of the various provinces. The various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005, which represents a 0.7% decrease year on year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed, with the number of deaths increasing 66.6% year on year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> TURIN, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Likely to End Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Reporters: Gao Peng, Ding Ying) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the Turin Winter Olympics could face a "prison term", but judging from things as they stand now, chances are slim that this will happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, leading figure in the first doping scandal of these Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the 16th, the Turin Winter Olympics saw its first doping scandal uncovered when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedron, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The following day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women's 15km individual biathlon at these Winter Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, the International Winter Biathlon Union decided to ban her from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has been a consistent rule of the International Olympic Committee that any athlete found to have used performance-enhancing drugs at an Olympics Games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation, but will receive no legal penalty. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But under Italian law, athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants. Judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance-enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In December last year, after one year of "bargaining", the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this Winter Olympics in accordance with Italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Following unremitting efforts by the International Olympic Committee, Italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the Winter Olympics to a promise that police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athletes' dwellings during the Winter Olympic Games. But athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by Italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Reports say that Pescante, the Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, had referred the Pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in Turin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But neither the International Olympic Committee nor Pescante himself has yet confirmed the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin to return to her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who worked for years in the World Anti-doping Agency, said that once Pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng added that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government had never been "thorough" in their anti-doping drive at the Winter Olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if Italian prosecutors did step in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on past instances of punishment handed down to Italian athletes that have used performance-enhancing drugs, the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than "two years of prison term served on probation". </seg>
<seg id="18"> For this reason, senior reporter of Italy's ANSA [pei ai]predicted that the possibility of Pyleva going to prison was "exceedingly slim" and that a fine would be the most she would receive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> also said  that although an Italian court can pass judgment in absentia, it would be impossible for the Italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refused to accept a judgment, there would be no way Italian authorities could detain her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) Bird flu has spread further on the African continent, says a summary report by a Xinhua overseas reporter. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The World Heath Organization (WHO) confirmed on the 17th that birds killed by the bird flu virus have been found in three regions in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, the H5 bird flu virus has also been found in France for the first time. Europe and Africa are on high alert and are strengthening anti-epidemic measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Hasan al-Bushra, advisor to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, said that at present dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been discovered in  Cairo and Giza in central Egypt and three areas in Minya in the country's south. The responsible departments of the Egyptian government have begun to slaughter domestic fowl that could be infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts say that Egypt is an important passage for migratory birds traveling to the Middle East and North Africa, so it is very likely that the bird flu virus was brought into the country by migrating birds. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on live fowl imports and will reinforce quarantine inspections at border entries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A poultry farm in Cameroon's capital Yaounde saw more than 800 birds die in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to call an immediate temporary halt to all imports of fowl and pork from Nigeria, where bird flu has occurred. It also called a temporary halt to the trade of fowl and related products in all markets in the border area between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With little delay, Cameroon's government also set up an epidemic monitoring network covering the entire border. The country's Pasteur Center and the National Veterinary Laboratory are also on an on-call state of alert so that laboratory tests related to the H5N1 virus can be initiated at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the presence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Laboratory test results released by Sweden's National Veterinary Institute show that the Swedish swans found dead Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Preliminary laboratory results by Denmark's National Veterinary Administration have also indicated that thirty dead swans found recently within Denmark's borders were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the Department of Agriculture said that Denmark cannot yet lower its guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Romania in Eastern Europe has had nine bird flu outbreaks so far this year. A WHO expert said on the 17th in Bucharest that almost every area in the Danube Delta region has seen cases of bird flu and that the situation must be treated seriously, adding that Romania may continually be threatened by bird flu over the next three to five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Asia, the government of Bangladesh has taken all necessary measures to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided books on the prevention of bird flu to relevant officials and at the same time has organized training for poultry farmers. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) The Blood Center of Zhejiang Province has revealed that China's first blood supply data management and control network system recently was formally established at the center in recent days and put online. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> An official from the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that from now on when any citizen in any county (municipality, district) in Zhejiang Province donates blood at an organization that supplies and collects blood, there will be a unique record number. When he donates blood again, the corresponding record number just needs to be entered and information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation records, date of last blood donation and whether blood donation is permitted will immediately appear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The official explained further that if when the corresponding record number is entered the system says the required period between blood donation is not yet over, it will indicate conditions to donate blood on this occasion have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will not only help protect the health of the blood donor, but will also help protect the health and safety of the blood user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Futhermore, when blood supply is limited, blood donors and their families will have a preferential right to blood. You only need to enter a valid blood donor ID and the blood donors data will immediately appear. It is extremely convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="3"> Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman of the film "Capote," widely regarding as having the best hope of taking this year's Oscar, revealed that when he was young and wild he wallowed in the clutches of drugs and alcohol with no way to escape; luckily he later succeeded in rehabilitation, allowing him to begin the peak of his acting career. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 6 from Beijing (reporters Han Jie and Xu Bo).  The reporters have learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that the "Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking" and "Guidelines on Electronic Banking Security Evaluation " the CBRC has released will be implemented on February 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A spokesperson for the CBRC said that according to the stipulations of the administrative methods, the relevant examination and approval methods of foreign capital financial organizations has basically not changed.  Even after branches of foreign banks obtain approval to open online bank services, if they need to add new online banking services the main reporting branch bank within the borders of China should carry out notification and evaluation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To standardize the utilization of the Internet for banking services by commercial banks, the People's Bank of China formulated and issued the "Temporary Methods for Online Banking Administration." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The spokesperson for the CBRC said that with the continuous development of electronic banking services among commercial banks, the temporary methods can no longer accommodate the needs of electronic banking risk supervision, therefore the CBRC formulated these two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to their spokesperson, the CBRC's firm belief in the qualification of security evaluation institutions is different from the administrative approval of qualification characteristics of industry or enterprise admittance.  It is not that the evaluation institutions are opening up required conditions for banking security evaluation, it's just a reference for financial institutions to select evaluation institutions with. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as security evaluation institutions are in accordance with the relevant conditions and demands, even if they have not had their qualifications recognized by the CBRC, financial institutions can still use them to implement electronic banking security evaluation, but they should carry out management according to the relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The "Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking" has 99 articles in 9 chapters. It is divided into General Provisions, Application and Modifications, Risk Management, Data Exchange and Transfer Management, Outsourcing Management, Cross-border Business Management, Supervision and Regulation Management, Legal Liability and Supplementary Provisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The "Electronic Banking Security Evaluation Guidelines" has 57 articles in 5 chapters. It is divided into General Provisions, Security Evaluation Institutions, Implementation of Security Evaluation, Security Evaluation Management and Supplementary Provisions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Selected Best of Newspapers and Periodicals) Shanghai: Persons with Concurrent Jobs and Graduates of Institutions of Higher Education Become Main Force of Hourly Wage Earners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 7 from Beijing. Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security announced its 'Guide to Minimum Hourly Wages for 2006' on February 6.  The number of jobs covered reached 120, 11 more than last time.  Wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to the estimations of relevant experts at the Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security, Shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report in "China Youth Magazine," graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs (holding two or more jobs at once) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs, it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs.  The proportion of this group reaches 51.1% of the whole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high, they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures, such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7%, and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to our understanding, some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of RMB, such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation.  The majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 RMB or more, such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs, wedding masters of ceremonies, and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Satisfying personal interests and expanding one's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, who holds the position of manager of the Human Resources Department of a certain enterprise, will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates, and he has opportunities to be involved in another area.  Of course, a monthly income of 2000 RMB also has a certain attraction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds, the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions.  Among those making hourly wages, 14% are university or technical school graduates of the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "At first I didn't want to work for hourly wages, but after a few months, I think it's better than going to work from nine to five." </seg>
<seg id="14"> After college student Huang graduated, the job she found wasn't very ideal.  Finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am very satisfied with my current job.  I make 100 RMB an hour, and the environment is good, what I want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to our understanding, hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience, exercise their working skills, increase their communication techniques, and grow social experiences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures, such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era-stylistic performance art positions.  Their proportion of hourly wages is 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly work positions have lower technical skills, such as food sales promoter and tally clerks.  Unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39%, among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 68.4% of workers that were unemployed, and a proportion of 58.7% among food and beverage jobs.  Hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Puts Forth 'Key Science Research Plan' for Next 15 Years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 9 from Beijing, (reporter Li Xing).  To increase the international competitiveness of China, greatly further maintainable development, and realize key development leaps, the "National Mid to Long Term Science and Technology Development Plan Guidelines (2006-2020)" released by the State Council on February 9 deploys four key science research plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> These four key science research plans are protein research, particle control research, nano research, and growth and procreation research. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The guidelines point out that protein science is the strategic highpoint in life sciences being intensely fought over in developed nations at present. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China must place emphasis on researching the key biology fields of transcriptomics, protein science, metabonomics, structural biology, and the functions and mutual effects of protein biology, system biology and protein biology with correlated calculations, methodology for protein research and basic research for relevant applications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The guidelines also believe that particle control research has an obvious forward looking nature and will likely produce a hard to calculate influence on human social and economic development 20 to 30 years from now. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China must put emphasis on researching particle communications mediums and control concepts and methods, particle computation, new particle effects limited to small particle systems, new concepts and new technical foundations for particle control attributes and measurement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Besides this, the guidelines point out, nano science and technology has already become the strategic choice for many nations in improving their core competitiveness and is also an area in which China hopes to realize great leaps in development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China's key research into this area will include the controlling methods of nano materials, self assembly and functionality, nanoelectronics, nano biology and nano medicine, nano scale attributes and measurement science, as well as effects of nano material and nano technology in energy resources, the environment, information technology, medicines, and other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> China's population growth is large and its inadequacies are many, organ transplants are seriously short and the peak of an aging society will soon arrive - therefore China urgently needs breakthroughs and technical innovations in growth and procreation science theory. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the guidelines, from 2006 to 2020 China will place emphasis on researching cell growth, division and control, the arising, maturing and impregnation of reproductive cells, the decline of human reproductive functions and the mechanisms of degenerative changes, safety and morals of aided reproduction and stem cell technology. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Expert: America Beating Drum of 'Chinese Military Threat' is Irrational Criticism </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua New February 9 from Beijing (reporters Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping)  The Pentagon's "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" formally handed over to Congress in recent days has for the first time referred to China as 'the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to America'. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts believe this is an irrational criticism of China's normal defense construction, a dramatization of the 'Chinese military threat theory', and is an interference in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" is the Pentagon's new national defense policy paper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of Chinese military force and what paths America should take to meet this problem.  The report directly brings up 'China' or 'Chinese' a total of 15 times, saying 'as a major and newly prosperous large nation, China has the most potential to carry out military competition with America.  If America does not have counter-measures, China will likely develop destructive military technologies, thus breaking America's advantage in conventional weapons.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Researcher Yao Yunzhu of the World Military Research Department of the China Military Science Institute says that, although high level American officials have expressed similar views many times before, this is the first time America put forward that 'China is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to America' in its 'defense strategy reports'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> 'This report for the first time clearly takes Russia, India, and China as newly rising strategic opponents, among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called Chinese military threat theory.' </seg>
<seg id="8"> Said Major General Peng Guangqian, researcher of the China Military Science Institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Worth noting is that on the same day that the "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" was formally handed in, American President Bush also handed to Congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007, in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion USD. </seg>
<seg id="10"> 'If you add on to this the budget for the military movements in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion USD, setting a new historic high' Peng Guangqian said. 'This is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian believes that the method of America concocting 'threat theories from other countries' reflects the Pentagon's usual style of 'creating enemies.'  Its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures, and dredging up even more profits for America's huge military industrial complex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts say, compared with America's huge military expenditures, China's defense expenditures are relatively limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Military expert Deng Hongzhou, who has taken part in the writing of China's Defense White Paper several times, said that since the 1990's, along with economic development, China's defense expenditures have increased, but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979, China's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005, China's defense expenditures were 244.656 billion RMB, equal to only approximately 1/14 of America's.  Average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1/60 of America's.  Per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1/30 of America's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> 'America's land area is about equal to China's land area, but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference.  It is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs.' </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, Director of the Research Department of China's Military Control and Disarmament Association, expressed that America should objectively appraise the situation of China's military construction. China's peaceful development does not mean that China and America will become military opponents in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The "China's Defense in 2004" White Paper said China staunchly follows the path of peaceful development, and carries out a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China has never become a threat to any country in the past or present, and will not become a threat in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Up until now, China has not established military bases in any country, and has not sent one soldier to any other country, while America has over 100 military bases abroad, and in the Asian Pacific region alone has in excess of 100,000 military forces deployed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Professor Zhu Feng of Beijing University's International Relations Institute said that China and America should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges, increase understanding and mutual trust, comprehensively further Chinese and American constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 9 from Ramallah (Internationl Observation). Hamas Looks for Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News reporter Hao Huangmin </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the Palestine Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) obtained victory in legislative elections, how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kinds of new policies Hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the attitude of resistance of America and Israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the Hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, various Palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation, and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (Sub Heading) Who Will the Position of Premier Fall to? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, there have been people in the outside world who worry a 'Hamas Premier' will likely see differently than the current high leader Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Also, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, emphasized that the new Palestinian government established by Hamas leaders will not continue to recognize Israel.  This intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="11"> America and Israel explicitly state they will not accept a Hamas government that controls real power, and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this has not obstructed Hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, to acquire international approval across the largest range possible, earlier domestic and foreign Hamas leaders meeting together in Egypt decided to choose independent Ismail Haniyeh, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Islamic University in Gaza, to be appointed the new premier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This move has still not received the responses of concerned parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestine Analyst Hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to, what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the 'hard' aspects of Hamas as much as possible.  Only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Sub Heading) How to Allocate Power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Looking at the internal makeup of the party, the biggest challenge that Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Palestine "Daily" published an analysis saying that while Hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects, in the area of being in power it lacks experience.  Hamas cooperating with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience being in power, would be the best strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner' relationship with Fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government, however Fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Opinions among those in the Fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same.  One faction advocates participating in the new government, and thus having something to say; another faction refuses the invitation of Hamas, and would rather be an 'active opposition faction' in the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of Abbas, Fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although this might be the case, Hamas and Fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Besides this, another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has also designed a technocracy government, but the concrete list of names is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In light of the attitude of Israel and America, a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to regulations of the Palestine "Basic Law," after the new legislature convenes on the February 16, the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Sub Heading) At a Loss About Armed Forces </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The weapons in the hands of Hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces. </seg>
<seg id="29"> America's and Israel's attitude is extremely stiff.  They staunchly demand Hamas give up violence, and reject Hamas taking part in government while carrying guns. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mashal emphasized on February 9 that armed resistance is the 'strategic choice' of his organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems: The legality of weapons, and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner, allowing its subordinate armed faction the 'Qawasameh tribe' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government's security organizations. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a Palestine ethnic power organization 'people's army.'  However it did not get a broad response, and also took criticism from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At present, Palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel, the vast majority of which come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Also, Fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations, such as the 'al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades' and the 'Fatah Hawks' and others. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must come to an understanding with Abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures, and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to the reports of local media, Abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments, while the police and people's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the Department of the Interior of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue, and as of now there is nothing further. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The "Report" shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic Survey Team successfully completed their task and returned to Shanghai.  Their tour of research lasted 151 days, a voyage of 26,500 knots. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic Survey Team left Shanghai, going to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific investigation activities, and will leave Zhongshan Station at the end of February 2006 to return to Shanghai via Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because this is the first time China has released its polar region survey report, the "2005 China Polar Region Survey Report" also carried out a review and summary of Chinese polar region surveys beginning in the early 1980's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the "Report", in 1983 China formally entered the "Antarctica Treaty", became a member country of the Antarctica Treaty System, and also became a negotiating country in the Antarctica Treaty, a member of the Antarctica Science Research Committee, a member of the Antarctica Council, and other influential international organizations dealing with Antarctica. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee, winning the right to decide policy and speak in international polar region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The "Report" points out that in over 20 years, China's polar region surveys have "continuously developed from nothing and for the first time have real scope."  The Antarctic and Arctic Science Survey System already has "three stations and one ship," that is: Changcheng Station established in February 1985 in Antarctica, Zhongshan Station established in February 1989 in Antarctica, Huanghe Station established in July 2004 in the Arctic, and the "Xuelong" class polar survey ship that began to undertake survey missions to the Arctic in 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The "Report" estimates that as of the end of 2005, China had already organized 22 Antarctic Science Surveys, two Arctic Science Surveys using the "Xuelong" as a platform, and two survey's from the Huanghe Arctic Station.  As of the present, China already has sent over 3000 people to personally go to the Antarctic or the Arctic to carry out on-sight surveys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "At present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third Antarctic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for China." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After over 20 years of hard work, China's polar region survey enterprise already has a definite position among the world's polar region surveys.  However, compared with the other main polar region surveying countries, there still exists a relatively large discrepancy.  We must push on ahead." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui revealed, China will publish polar region survey reports every year from now on. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Tokyo (reporter Qian Zheng)  Researchers of Japan's Tokai University have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney.  It not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, it also has functions to maintain useful substances.  It has a small volume, is easy to transplant, and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in previous days in the "Nikkei Business Daily", the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts.  One part is the 'artificial kidney unit' that strains out waste material and water from blood, the other part is the 'artificial urine tubes' that returns water, amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The 'artificial kidney unit' and the 'artificial urine tubes' are both made up of hollow fibers.  The inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of 'amyloid degeneration related to dialysis' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood, while also allowing the glucose, vitamins, minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste, and could not totally get rid of everything.  They also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney.  Pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used . </seg>
<seg id="8"> After two weeks, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney was functioning. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At present they are developing a biological artificial kidney using cells from human kidneys, and will begin clinical research after they verify its safety. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Safe Production of Electricity Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing (reporter An Bei).  An official of the State Electricity Supervision Committee said on February 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend, the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Shi Yubo, Chairman of the State Electricity Supervision Committee, said at the 5th (expanded) State Electricity Safe Production Committee Conference being held in Beijing that China's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend.  It satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer peaks, realized the safe supplying of energy, actively responded to the attack of natural disasters, and basically assured the safe and stable operations of the electricity system.  Safe electricity production facility accidents and normal electricity grid accidents saw a large decrease over that of last year, and the health level of electricity facilities received enhancement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups, safe electricity production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include the continued existence of regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight.   The supply of electricity coal (coal used in generating electricity) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism.  At the same time, the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls, seriously influencing the stable operations of generator groups.  The structure of some electricity grids are weak, facilities are old and bring hidden problems to system safety.  The situation of common electricity infrastructure accidents has still not received a fundamental turn around, and the trend is still grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system, many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed.  The new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce, and secure a normal production order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006, Shi Yubo expressed that we must further solidify the basic tasks of safe electricity production management, speed up the establishment and perfection of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms, and increase the ability to handle unexpected incidents.  In addition, we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant grid and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system.  We must also continue to do the tasks of supervision management and informational construction for large dam hydro electric plants, assure the safety of large dams, strengthen safety management of electricity construction, and decrease the occurrence of injuries or deaths from accidents.  Finally, we must continue to strengthen information reporting tasks and ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and free flow of electricity safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to our understanding, by uniting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modifications and perfections of the already published "Temporary Investigation Regulations on Electricity Production Accidents" this year, while the relevant accompanying documents on large hydro electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005 China's use of electricity reached 2.468 trillion kilowatt hours, a 13.5% increase over the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non-advantageous situations, various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management.  Last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation's electricity production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> 74 electricity grid accidents occurred, a decline of 127 from the previous year.  427 facility accidents occurred, a decline of 132 from the previous year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing (reporters Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin). Temporary representative of the South African Embassy  in China Vusi B.

<seg id="3"> He also expressed that the South African government will do its best to "crush all forms of criminal activities." </seg>

<seg id="4"> Koloane expressed that the South African government hopes to "lower to zero" the crime rate, and hopes that the safety of the lives and property of all foreigners working in South Africa will receive the ample assurance of local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since the beginning of 2006, there have already been 4 Chinese citizens that have been murdered in South Africa.  The Chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already put forward discussion of this to South African parties, and warned Chinese citizens traveling in South Africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge.  Overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express the most sincere condolences and mourning to the families of those murdered." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Koloane said, "We feel apologetic because of this.  Please allow the people of China to believe that the South African government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves China." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the statement of the Chinese Embassy in South Africa, South African police have already successfully broken the case of Chinese Fujian female Chen Jianqing's murder on February 5, and one suspect is already arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At present the police are pursuing another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also according to the South African Embassy in China, a criminal wanted as a suspect in the January shooting of a Hong Kong businessman has already been arrested by South African police, and the belongings of the murdered person have already been retrieved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> When talking about the influence that Chinese citizens being murdered is likely to produce, Koloane believes that these events "indeed" will produce some negative effects on the trade, tourism, and other areas of exchange between the two nations; but looking at the long term, the effects "shouldn't be great." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the statements from Assistant Director of Tourism Manqoba Nyembezi of the South African Embassy, the Embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to South Africa by Chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also, according to China's official statistical data, in 2005 South Africa continued to keep China as South Africa's largest trading partner. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion USD, a year on year growth of 23%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, personnel in the tourism field believe that the Chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of Chinese going to South Africa to travel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> According to the statistics of the South African Tourism Bureau, the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 Chinese tourists travel to South Africa, a drop of 14.9% with that of the year before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> At present there are around 200,000 Chinese that live in South Africa, spread throughout South Africa's cities, towns, and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in South Africa is great, the level of unemployment high, guns are everywhere, and there is no deterrence from a death penalty; thus the crime rate is high. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not understand English but keep cash on their persons and at home, they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Censorship of Torture and Exhorted Confessions Still Key Task for Ministry of Public Safety </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 14 from Beijing (reporter Meng Nuo).  Department Head Zheng Baigang of the Police Affairs Censorship Department of the Ministry of Public Safety (MPS) pointed out when responding to the questions of foreign reporters at a MPS news conference that the so called situation of "using unsuitable methods to make suspects admit crimes" in China is definitely not permitted. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The focal point of the work of the censorship department is to prevent the occurrences of these problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He also pointed out that among some international organizations, the understanding of the situation of law enforcement of China's police is incorrect and not comprehensive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The latest material supplied by the MPS on February 14 shows that the MPS released "Regulations for Cases of Public Safety Organizations Carrying Out Detainment" in 2002, and "Regulations on Public Safety Organizations' Suitable Use of Interrogation" in 2004, which reasonably ensures that grass-root public safety organizations will use suitable interrogation and detainment procedures that adhere to the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, to greatly further the "three controls" (that is controlling exhorted confessions under torture, controlling the abuse of police guns, and controlling the abuse of compulsory procedures); the entire nations' public safety organizations' police affairs censorship force has persisted in deeply entering into precincts, criminal police ranks, patrol police ranks, traffic police ranks, and the supervising locations of public safety and other grass-roots, first line law enforcement units and other law enforcement scenes.  They have carried out overt and covert investigations, found leaks and fixed deficiencies, given warnings, and stopped problems before they arise in the law enforcement elements concerned with the rights of personal safety of citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To completely prevent the occurrence of law enforcement problems, the Department of Police Affairs Censorship has further extended the antennas of law enforcement censorship, and enlarged supervision and inspection to the suitable use of citation procedures, interrogation, connecting to police through 110, case registration statistics,  management of valuables involved in cases, public security fine personnel, the recording of information and material on criminals' weapons and vehicles and other law enforcement elements. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 15 from Beijing (reporter Li Jiangtao)  After several days of hurried decorations, the funeral hall that Beijing University set up to remember school Academician Wang Xuan at Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall formally opened at 9:00 a.m. on February 15. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At a little past eight in the morning, the opening of the funeral hall had still not occurred, yet there were already several tens of people queued outside. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This reporter saw inside the great memorial hall of Beijing University's Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall that hanging on the walls of the great hall was a black banner: "Solemnly mourn Academician Wang Xuan." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner was a huge picture of Wang Xuan (over 10 square meters big).  He is wearing glasses, smiling slightly, and his temperament is of learned elegance. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On both sides of the portrait were several dragon cypress trees and several tens of flower wreaths lined up on each side. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Among these, the funeral couplet of one of the flower wreaths said:  "This foundational skill that glorified China began in the Qin Dynasty and matured in the Tang dynasty / he sent off lead writing implements and welcomed in electronics as a modern day Bi Sheng to draw a blueprint for his invention." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> There was soft funeral music in the hall and the atmosphere was solemn and heavy. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among those mourning Academician Wang Xuan were Beijing University leaders, teachers and students.  There were friends, colleagues, students, neighbors, and even people he did not know that had specially come. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some had fresh flowers in their hands, some held flower baskets, and every person had a small white flower pinned to his or her chest.  They slowly made their way to before the picture of Academician Wang Xuan and bowed to show their respect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many people could not help but to shed warm tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, who once was the bureau head of the State Cultural Bureau, is an old Beijing University alumni.  He told this reporter that over ten years ago when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on science and technology innovation to cadres of the provincial committee. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Academician Wang Xuan was a model for both pursuing studies and personal conduct.  He made important contributions to the nation and society and the people will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Professor Jin Ruilin of Beijing University Institute of Law was an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan's of over 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A few days ago he just got out of the hospital.  Today he insisted on coming here to say goodbye to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Mr. Jin left a message in the message book, he could not control his grief, and had to wipe away the tears flowing from his eyes several times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told reporters, the daily life of Professor Wang Xuan was extremely thrifty and simple, "When he lived in the Tongfuyuan Community, he already was a professor, and already had very high accomplishments, yet still only lived in a very small bungalow for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he moved to the Chengzeyuan Community, and lived in a 78 square meter place for over 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Beijing University gave him a 140 plus square meter apartment in Langqiying Academician Building, but he didn't want it.  He also refused a high-rise apartment that Fangzheng Mansions offered him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin remembered with great emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign nations, these nations offered him a very high salary to stay, but he always resolutely refused. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "At first he insisted on not applying to be an academician, it was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan motivated him several times that he went and filled out the form." </seg>
<seg id="22"> What leaves Mr. Jin deeply touched also includes Wang Xuan's attitude toward training young people.  "He emphasized several times that 'what successes do I have now, it's not about me, but instead should be about relying on training young people.'" </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that when he was in his 50s, Wang Xuan began to pay attention to training younger people.  He always emphasized that he must pave the road, be happy to be a ladder, and yield to younger people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "This is not easy at all for a scientist that had great accomplishments." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> This reporter learned from the Beijing News Center that from 9:00 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 p.m. on February 19, Academician Wang Xuan's funeral hall will be open to the public every day from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., allowing people from various fields to come and mourn. </seg>

At present many websites all rely on reproduced news reports from a large volume of newspapers and magazines and other media to increase their hit rates, however many have not obtained authorization, and do not pay compensation.  Department Head Wang Ziqiang of the National Copyright Administration's Department of Copyrighting stated at a news conference held at the News Office of the State Council that the information network broadcasting rights protection articles which the State Council will introduce will supply a resolution concerning the problem of payment for works reproduced on the internet,. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the regulations of the laws currently in effect, works already published in newspapers and periodicals can be used by newspapers and periodicals without the agreement of the author as long as the author doesn't make a declaration of "cannot be used."  However, newspapers and periodicals must pay compensation for works republished.  The National Copyright Administration has set the standards for compensation for reproduced works of newspapers and periodicals specifically according to what the law stipulates. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the regulations of laws currently in effect, newspaper and periodical agencies enjoy the rights of this statutory license, but at present the Internet does not enjoy these rights. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to relevant judicial interpretation by the supreme people's court, statutory license for reproduction of newspaper and periodical works can be suitably used for the Internet.  Short articles published on newspapers, periodicals, and the Internet can be used by internet sites without obtaining approval while also paying compensation as long as the author does not declare works "cannot be used." </seg>

News Official Vyacheslav Sedov of Russia's Department of Defense gave a talk to media on February 15 saying that the decision of the Georgian Parliament concerning Russia's peace keeping forces will not influence the peace keeping activities of Russian soldiers in the short term.  Russian soldiers will continue to carry out their peace keeping mission in the conflict region of South Ossetia. </seg>

<seg id="4"> He emphasized that this decision of the Georgian Parliament will cause the relations of Georgia and Russian to take another step toward deterioration. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 16 from Changchun (reporter Zhou Liquan).  After an extremely large fire occurred in Liaoyuan City's Central Hospital in Jilin Province, the accident investigation group confirmed 11 responsible.  Among those responsible, Zhang Diankun, head of a team of electricians, and three others will be prosecuted as suspects in a major accident due to negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire occurred in Liaoyuan City's largest hospital - Central Hospital, causing 39 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The area this fire reached across was over 5000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to our understanding, this is the largest fire accident in any of the nation's medical or sanitation system since the founding of new China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to investigations, the accident happened at around 4:30 p.m. that day when Liaoyuan City's Central Hospital suddenly lost electricity.  According to the circuitry design of the hospital, if the electricity goes out, the transformer breaker should automatically switch to the auxiliary breaker and continue to maintain a normal supply of electricity to the hospital.  However, at that time the electricity breaker did not automatically switch.  Zhang Diankun, head of a team of electricians, forced a power transmission without investigating the reason the electricity stopped, leading to the start of the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Also, the underground electrical cable lines giving off smoke had over ten cables that were disorderly and unsystematically tangled together.  These electrical cables should have been laid out and placed extremely orderly, and fire protection layers should have been installed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Therefore, team leader Zhao Yongchun of an electricity installation team of Liaoyuan City's Textile Company, retired cadre (high level engineer) Sun Fenglin of Liaoyuan's department of electric utilities, and retired worker of Liaoyuan's Central Hospital Jin Chengtai who continued to work after retirement will also be prosecuted as suspects in the major accident due to negligence case </seg>

<seg id="1"> CCP Organization Ministry Demands to Further Enlarge Strength of Supervision of Leading Cadres and Cadre Selection and Appointment </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 16 from Beijing.  The CCP Organization Ministry has recently published its suggestions on strengthening cadre supervision tasks. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The suggestions require all levels of the organization ministry to start out from a attitude of strict management as well as concern and care for cadres.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As to the aspect of supervision of leadership groups and leading cadres, the suggestions point out that the ministry must tirelessly grasp the education of idealism and conviction as well as anti-corruption and clean government education.  It must implement education into the training and selection of cadres and their management and supervision, lead and urge leading cadres to strengthen party spirited self-cultivation.  It must maintain establishing the party for the public, executing government for the people; and build a firm theoretical and moral front line refusing corruption and preventing against dissent. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As to carrying out discussions on appointed positions with newly elevated cadres, the ministry must put forward clear demands as to aspects of integrity and self discipline. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The ministry must urge leadership groups of all levels to maintain democratic centralism; it must establish robust agendas and rules and procedures for policy making; it must seriously carry out a political system mutually uniting group leadership and individual separation of duties and authority. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The ministry must especially grasp the supervision of the main persons in authority of leadership groups.  The organization (personnel) ministry authorities must often talk candidly with the main authorities in the next lower level leadership groups; and understand the situation of their thinking, tasks, style, and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The ministry must establish a healthy leading cadre daily management and supervision system, carry out understanding and analysis of the thinking styles of leading cadre ranks at set times, and put forward opinions and procedures to resolve problems. </seg>

<seg id="11"> As to prominent problems of leading cadres brought to light from the people, the ministry must seriously investigate and understand these problems.  For problems that really exist, it must distinguish the situation and administer criticism and education or hand over the case to relevant organizations for processing.  For those problems that constitute undisciplined or illegal activities, they should be handed over to offices that carry out discipline or maintain the law.  As to those cases were no problems are found after being investigated, the ministry should take suitable methods to bestow clarification and redemption. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time the ministry must also unite the strengthening of supervision with encouraging cadres to bravely seek out and exploit innovation, and pay attention to discovering and commending superior cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The suggestions require that all levels of the organization (personnel) ministry truly strengthen the selection and appointment tasks of party and government cadres. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The ministry must further perfect the supervision of recommendations and nominations, investigations, preliminary discussions, discussions and decisions and other links in the advancement of cadres.  It must seriously grasp the selection and use of personnel; supply effective safeguards by going to all levels of leading positions for selection of cadres that are reliable in government, skillful in their work, steadfast in their style, and are trustworthy among the people. </seg>

<seg id="7"> Bob Tsao, who was UMC chairman at the time, then publicly stated that UMC did not break any regulations of the Taiwanese authorities, UMC provided help to HeJian for the long term benefits of UMC, and if UMC did not enter the mainland market as fast as possible it would lose business opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After this, the Taiwan authorities "financial supervision and management committee" used the breaking of regulations relevant to the revealing of commercial information as an excuse to issue a fine of 3 million NT. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the UMC board of directors received the letter of resignation of Bob Tsao.  Several hours later Bob Tsao was formally sued for suspicion of breaking regulations in investing in the mainland. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Likely to End Inconclusive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 17 from Turin.  News Analysis: Pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News reporter Gao Peng and Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the Turin Olympics would likely face "the specter of jail;" however, looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this Winter Olympics, Russian biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva, will not likely face jail-time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Turin Olympic Committee revealed the first stimulant scandal of the games on February 16.  It was discovered that Olga Pyleva used the prohibited stimulant Carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had already been expelled from the Winter Olympics, and the gold medal she won in the women's biathlon 15 km individual race at this Winter Olympics had already been stripped from her. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The International Biathlon Union passed a punitive decision to ban Pyleva from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has always been that the International Olympic Committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the Olympic Games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away, but they would not receive the punishment of the law. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, according to Italian law, athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates.  Those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Last December, the International Olympic Committee and the Italian Government concluded "negotiations" that had lasted as long as a year, finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to Italian Law at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> After the tireless efforts of the International Olympic Committee, Italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics, promising that during the Winter Olympics police would not enter the Olympic village and search the residences of athletes.  However, athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by Italian authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Reports state that Mario Pescante, the official supervising the Turin Olympics for the Italian government, has already handed over the Pyleva stimulant incident to Turin investigating authorities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the International Olympic Committee and Pescante have not confirmed this as of present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian team doctor for the biathlon team Andrey Dmytriev revealed on February 17 that Pyleva had already left Turin and returned to Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Chinese Sports Official Shi Liancheng, who worked for many years at the world anti-stimulant organization, believes that as soon as Pyleva returns to Russia, this incident's ending will likely be "inconclusive." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Liancheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant problems at the Winter Olympics, and although the Italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play, the results are hard to predict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in Italy, the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than "two years of suspended imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Therefore, senior reporter Pieri of Italy's Ansa News expressed that the likelihood of Pyleva going to prison is "extremely small," and at most a fine will be given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Pieri expressed that although Italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present, Italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring Pyleva back for punishment. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, then Italy will have no way to get her. </seg>

<seg id="14"> However the ministry of agriculture expressed that Demark still cannot be worry-free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Romania in Eastern Europe has already seen nine bird flu epidemic outbreaks this year.  Experts of the WHO said on February 17 in Bucharest that virtually all areas of the delta region of the Danube River have bird flu, and this situation must be dealt with seriously.  Romania is expected to be threatened by the bird flu for the next 3 to 5 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Asia's Bangladesh, the government has taken all needed steps to prevent bird flu. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's again direct our attention to the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government has written a letter to the IAEA requesting for the removal of all the equipment monitoring Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Due to the IAEA decision to report the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has announced the termination of all its support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the IAEA to conduct snap inspection of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In response to the current tensions concerning the Iran nuclear issue, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens, Greece, that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will become the motivation for the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that day that Russia's proposal to Iran for establishing a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia still stands. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two sides may conduct negotiations on this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the same day, Lugar, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at the UN headquarters in New York that the US does not endorse Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some recent news report said that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli Air Force may deal serious blows to Iran's nuclear facilities if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to Xinhua News Agency, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue so as to help Iran obtain the legal right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kislyak said that Russia's proposal for a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still valid now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to have negotiations with Iran on this issue in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13"> At the end of December last year, Russia submitted a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint uranium enrichment enterprise by the two countries in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Both the EU and the US indicated that they can accept this plan for a compromise. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that though the IAEA reported the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, it did not hand over the agency's responsibility for handling the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>

<seg id="18"> According to the IAEA resolution, IAEA Director General ElBaradei will submit a report on the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating this report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We think this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill the relevant Security Council resolution and its commitments without submitting or referring the issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, China has been seeking a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic channels. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, director-general of Arms Control and Disarmament Department of China's Foreign Ministry, and Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and chief nuclear negotiator, held talks on the Iran nuclear issue in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Chinese side hopes that Iran should pay attention to the key issue of the international community and create conditions for peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Solving the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese side but also, as we believe firmly, conforms to the interests of all parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For that purpose, we also call upon all relevant parties in the international community again not to abandon diplomatic efforts for this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is currently forming a new Palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that except for the candidate for prime minister, the name list of the new government's cabinet has been basically finalized. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This led outsiders to have a variety of speculations on the candidate for prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas is preparing to nominate al-Khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the Islamic University in Gaza, as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but this nomination has not been officially submitted to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Backed by Hamas, 50-year-old al-Khudairi participated in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council as an independent candidate last month. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Khudairi never mentioned violence or anything against Israel in his public speech. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, he said that Palestine needs internal reforms. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently, a senior Hamas delegation is visiting Cairo and discussing with Egypt on the issue of Hamas forming a new Palestinian government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Khalid Mashal, one of the delegates, told the news media on the 8th that in spite of the pressure that has kept coming from the international community and some Arab countries, the Palestinian government formed by the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, Mashal also warned Abbas in his speech not to willfully change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without prior consultation with Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts consider this a response to Abbas's plan to appoint Interior Minister Yusuf as deputy commander of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, regarding the issue of forming a new Palestinian autonomous government, Mashal refused to confirm the news that Hamas is preparing to nominate al-Khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the Islamic University in Gaza, to serve as prime minister of the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mashal said that the candidate for prime minister has not been finalized. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to Mashal's reiteration of refusing to recognize Israel, Marzouk, another Hamas political leader, said in an interview with Egyptian TV that Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legitimate status of Israel, but the new government will continue to keep contact with Israel in various areas, because recognizing Israel or not is a totally different thing from whether to have contact with it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apart from the fresh or old hatred of the three Hamas prime minister candidates against Israel, the issue of the territory has also been a tough question concerning Palestinian-Israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Israeli Acting Prime Minister Olmert said in an interview with Israel TV Channel 2 on the 7th that Israel must separate from Palestine by setting permanent borders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This means that Israel will have to withdraw from part of its territories in the West Bank. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control major Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley area and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's Residence on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2"> He said that the current development of the incident concerning the cartoons of Muhammad, founder of Islam, is being taken advantage of by extremists. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He ((stated)) that Denmark respects all religious beliefs and calls for the same right of everyone.  Er, he also called on Muslims to remain restrained and not to appeal to violence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At 4:30 p.m. on the 7th, Prime Minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference at Denmark's Prime Minister's Residence. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Rasmussen said. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The violent incidents occurring at the embassies of several European countries are no longer something between Muslim countries and Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is very important for the Danish government and Danish people to get the broad support of the international community to resolve this tough issue. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We are allied with France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some organizations of other European countries and the United States in Muslim countries are cooperating closely. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Just a few minutes ago, US President Bush made a phone call here. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In the phone call, he expressed support for Denmark, standing by Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Rasmussen said, we also think that we should resolve this issue through dialogue and tolerance, not through violence. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We stress freedom and democracy, and respect the precious value of religious belief. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today I appeal to people in all Muslim countries to work together to suppress violence and prevent it from spreading. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We need to resolve the issue through dialogue, not through violence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Today we are facing growing international developments of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We saw the Danish national flag burnt and the embassy damaged. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We saw Danish people being considered intolerant people and the enemy of Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Extremists and radicals are taking advantage of the incident of cultural conflict to escalate the situation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Rasmussen stressed, we, Denmark and Danish people, are not the enemy of Islam and other religions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For generations, Danish people have been pursuing human rights, democracy, and freedom beyond politics. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We will continue to strive for that. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This is part of Denmark's history and also a fundamental part of Danish society. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="26"> We respect all religious beliefs. </seg>

<seg id="29"> NTD correspondents Li Luo and Dan Ni reporting from Copenhagen, Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Angry with the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad, Iranian extremists attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again on Tuesday, throwing gas bombs. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the meantime, a state-owned Iranian newspaper, in retaliation, held a contest on cartoons about the Nazi Holocaust. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The United States denounced the move as taking the opportunity to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad's persistent outrageous anti-Israeli practices. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Some twenty to thirty protesters climbed over the wall and entered the Danish embassy compound in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In addition, more than three hundred people threw rocks and gas bombs at the building from outside. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The day before, student members of Iran's hard-line militia led hundreds of demonstrators in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The controversial cartoons were first published by the Jutland Post in Denmark in September of last year. </seg>
<seg id="37"> They were successively reprinted in other European countries and three Arab newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In retaliation, Hamshahri, Iran's best-selling newspaper, recently announced that it would hold a contest on cartoons depicting the slaughter of Jews by the Nazi Germany. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The move was strongly denounced by the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="40"> US State Department spokesman McCormack said that he thinks the move by the best-selling Iranian newspaper Hamshahri was to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad's vicious anti-Israeli remarks. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated the US support of freedom of speech in all parts of the world, including Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he thinks Hamshahri's cartoon contest was totally a different thing from the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad by the Danish media. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said, I don't think that someone will mention Iran's freedom of the press in connection with the freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad once called the Holocaust a myth and urged to wipe Israel off the map, setting off widespread criticism by the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="45"> McCormack thinks that Hamshahri is funded by the conservative Tehran municipal government. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It was no coincidence that it should hold this cartoon contest. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Since Attorney Gao Zhicheng initiated a coordinated 24-hour hunger strike campaign in ten cities across the country on February 14, protesting CPC persecution, recently another 170 Shanghai petitioners collectively signed on, expressing their willingness to participate in this human rights hunger strike. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In addition, they said they will continue to publicize the signatures and number of people in the second group of participants. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Next, let's take a look at an interview report by this station. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to our understanding, under the government's intentional manipulation, real estate prices in Shanghai have become among the highest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Many government units think of all kinds of ways to forcibly tear down citizens' residences in high-priced neighborhoods without giving reasonable compensation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> These ordinary people who have suffered compulsory eviction, thereby losing their homes, have suddenly lost their sources of income. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Children are unable to pay tuition, and cannot attend school. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For many years, most people who appealed to higher authorities have been sent to reform-through-labor camps for long periods of time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> According to statistical data, Shanghai is the region of China with the largest number of people appealing to higher authorities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Han Zhongming used to own a storefront, yet it was forcibly torn down.  His private residence was also sold by others for profit. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He was put under house arrest by authorities and was even detained because he appealed to higher authorities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Having jumped from a building and slit his wrists, among other forms of protest, he was only recently released. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Chen Enjuan's storefront was also forcibly torn down by the government. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The government hired goons to drag her family of three out of their home and used bulldozers to raze the house together with the furniture. </seg>
<seg id="15"> She was sent to a reform-through-labor camp for nearly two years because she appealed to higher authorities. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Speaking about this hunger strike in support of the protest, Chen Enjuan said that besides it was for protesting against government iniquity, </seg>
<seg id="17"> Attorney Gao has also given us a lot of help and very unselfishly helped us. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We are safeguarding our rights because we want democracy, ah, because we are thinking of the next generation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Our older generation has suffered enough.  We also need to make sure that the next generation will not suffer persecution.  That is why we want to participate in that human rights campaign.  We cannot give up. </seg>
<seg id="20"> According to the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions, a Geneva-based human rights organization, China has been listed among countries with the most serious housing rights violations in the world. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This has been an interview report by NTD News correspondent Wang Xin and guest reporter Gu Qing'er. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In response to the new round of human rights hunger strike campaign initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng, many democracy activists and ordinary citizens in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Calgary, Canada, and the greater Philadelphia area in the United States continued to voice their support in various forms on February 15. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The following is a comprehensive report by this station's correspodnent. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Based on the 24-hour coordinated hunger strike campaign in ten provinces and cities across China on February 14 initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng to protest CPC tyranny, a signature drive has been launched on the streets of Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Legislator Leung Kwok-hung, who supports Attorney Gao Zhicheng's hunger strike campaign, said that CPC authorities recently have made reckless arrests of human rights activists, which is a dangerous signal showing that this government is absolutely not based on popular will. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The same day happened to be the day for Legislator Attorney Ho Chun-yan, who is preparing to establish a human rights observation team, to have his weekly one-day fast. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that this week on this day, he would introduce to outsiders how a human rights attorney in China works. </seg>
<seg id="28"> At the same time, he is sure that this kind of human rights campaign will certainly continue. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On February 13, Epoch Times employees and Falun Gong practitioners in greater Calgary, Canada, held a joint press conference in front of the Chinese consulate to voice their support for the human rights hunger strike relay at home and abroad initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng.  In addition, they also protested against the atrocities committed by CPC overseas special agents against Falun Gong practitioner Li Yuan in the United States, calling on the Canadian government as well as all righteous individuals at home and abroad to pay attention to and voice their support for China's human rights movement. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This is Warner Village Square in downtown Taipei. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The global hunger strike relay against persecution initiated by the Epoch Times has entered its second day. </seg>

<seg id="39"> "This is extremely important. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It will absolutely become a force. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The evil hand and its vicious tyranny will find it very hard to subdue." </seg>
<seg id="42"> More than 40 people from Delaware, Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and New York who care about China's democracy and freedom attended a press conference on the global human rights hunger strike relay held in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, condemning CPC special agents' armed beating of Dr. Li Yuan, technical supervisor of the Epoch Times, in broad daylight, and voiced their support for the righteous act of Attorney Gao Zhicheng in China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> On February 17, the Indian Border Security Force stepped up patrols along the border with Nepal. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Due to concerns that increasing Maoist rebellions over the past few months may spill across the border, three new battalions have been added to the BSF with the responsibility of guarding the 200-kilometer-long Indian-Nepalese border in the district of Darjeeling. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nepal has the Himalayas in the north. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It borders India on the other three sides with a border that extends for 1,477 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maoist rebels often sneak into Indian border villages and acquire weapons from local gangs and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Sanaya, BSF deputy inspector-general in the Ranidanga area, said that their current 26 battalions will be increased to 36 battalions in order to facilitate patrols of the 100-kilometer-long border between the districts of Darjeeling and West Sikkim. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sanaya noted that according to reports, India's Kamatapur Liberation Organisation has joined forces with Maoist rebels in the districts of Jhapa and Ilam in eastern Nepal. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The BFS will set up 18 border observation posts to further strengthen border security. </seg>
<seg id="9"> BFS patrols will bring along well-trained police dogs to detect explosives and drugs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Border officials also began to thoroughly inspect all vehicles and passengers passing through sensitive border checkpoints. </seg>
<seg id="11"> India is worried that these people may form an alliance with extreme leftists in India. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Maoist rebellions have destroyed the entire country's economy and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On Friday, Japan's cabinet announced the GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> After price adjustments, the October-December quarter had a real increase of 1.4% over the previous quarter, a rate of increase higher than the expected 1.2%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main factors were strong domestic demand and growth in exports to major countries such as China and the US, indicating signs of sustained economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Japan saw economic growth.  Furthermore, from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2005, it was the largest rate of growth.  It was mainly helped by the stability of personal expenditures, capital expenditures, and exports. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, in April Japan's central bank will end the exceptionally lax currency policy of the past five years, which also backed financial market expectations of economic health. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Following slight improvements in unemployment and wages, consumer expenditures from October to December rose 0.8%. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Nikkei Index rose after the GDP data was released, but dropped 0.74% by the end of the morning session. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Japanese yen fell after rising temporarily, with the transaction price fluctuating around 118.15 Japanese yen to the US dollar. </seg>

<seg id="23"> Although Kerry Packer, the wealthiest person in Australia and a media tycoon, has passed away, the state memorial service held for him on February 17 brought together celebrities from various fields. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Among others, Hollywood movie star Tom Cruise and his fiancee Katie Holmes, Best Actor Oscar winner Russell Crowe, and renowned golfer Norman all came to attend. </seg>

<seg id="26"> Kerry Packer, this 68-year-old multi-millionaire, passed away in his sleep on December 26, 2005. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He used to control the Australian media and changed the face of international cricket. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Immediately following the IAEA decision to submit the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council for resolution, Iran reiterated that there is no room for it to have any negotiation with the US, one of the sponsors. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the US has so far been not to discuss and negotiate over the relations with the other party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said that the West made a huge mistake to submit the nuclear issue to the Security Council, which shows the Western interference in the development of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Iran said on Sunday that it will terminate its cooperation with the IAEA.  In addition, it will resume uranium enrichment and ban snap inspection of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, Iran's attitude is now quite firm on this issue, while the US takes an even firmer attitude. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Er, US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has frequently reiterated that the use of force will not be ruled out on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, now rumors said that the US military is indeed carrying out such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are researching and developing a super-sized mother of all bombs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Er, once the Defense Department issues the order, they will use this super-sized bomb to blow up Iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Then, how big a bomb is this mother of all bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Its weight alone is said to be more than thirty thousand pounds, which is equivalent to that of a two-story bus.  Er, in addition, it is also very large in size. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, the main purpose of developing such a super bomb is to blow up some underground facilities in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since it has an extremely powerful penetration, it can penetrate the concrete as well as steel plate, probably causing a large pit of about 60 feet long and half a mile in size.  Er, it will destroy many underground construction and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, it now seems that the United States has really started to sharpen its spear or make bombs at the last minute in this respect. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumsfeld said that no method will be ruled out on this issue, the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.  The method of force has already been put on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, the Iran nuclear issue is continuing to escalate.  Well, er, relevant Iranian officials in China said in an interview with this station that actually Iran still insists on cooperating with the international community through peaceful negotiations, er, in hopes of relieving the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, they also said that Iran will adjust the content of its nuclear project cooperation with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> With regard to the upcoming second round of talks on the uranium enrichment cooperation project between Iran and Russia on February 16, the Iranian side said that the talks will be carried out as scheduled, but it stressed that the content of talks will be adjusted based on the current developments of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Earlier Russia always expressed its support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy and said it would not refer the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, now we see they have agreed to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Under this new situation now, we may make some changes regarding our policy agreed upon with Russia earlier. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Yet, before the UN Security Council makes its final decision in March on whether to adopt economic and political sanctions, Iran maintains that it will continue to negotiate with relevant international institutions.  At the same time it is willing to cooperate with the international community to relieve the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We emphasized that Iran will not relinquish its right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in order to attain its own economic and national development. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated any relevant international law, and we hope the United States can also understand that. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the issues of Afghanistan and Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the US itself is well aware of this point. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With regard to the so-called military attacks, we have not seen that the US has declared any explicit position. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We don't want to see the crisis further escalate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We also emphasize on using the method of peaceful negotiations, but we will not yield to pressure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In addition ((agebi)) also expressed hope that China will continue to cooperate with Iran on the basis of its original position. </seg>

<seg id="29"> This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="30"> As the blizzard swept across the US northeast region, New York City is naturally one of the cities affected. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Let's now connect with Luo Xiaoying, our New York-based correspondent, to find out about the local situation. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hello, Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hello, Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="35"> With such a heavy snowfall here, how exactly is everything going? </seg>
<seg id="36"> I heard that some places did not even have power supply. </seg>
<seg id="37"> What other places are affected? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Yes, that's right. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In fact, this blizzard covered quite an extensive area, ah. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Well, I am happy to tell you that we have now finally seen that the blizzard has stopped. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In spite of the fierce onset of the blizzard, oh, no serious casualties have been reported. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Within its scope, several states in the eastern US were affected.  For instance, Maryland recorded 21 inches of snow, Pennsylvania, 19 inches, and the areas in New York and New Jersey, over 24 inches. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Flurries of snow can be seen from Virginia to Maine, or even Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Well, er, as you mentioned just now, um, many places in the Washington area and Baltimore indeed experienced power shortage. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The %pw total number of households cut from power is probably more than one hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Well, New York City is fine.  The outage, er, power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is very normal.  Only some places in the Long Island area experienced power outage. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The state of Rhode Island declared a state of emergency. </seg>

<seg id="49"> With regard to traffic and transportation, oh, earlier the three major airports in the, um, New York area were all closed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, er, toward evening, we found, for instance, the Newark airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia airport in New York have started to show some signs of resuming airport operations. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So, some people estimated that these airports may be opened in a few hours. </seg>
<seg id="52"> For example, Delta Airlines, eh, Delta Airlines, it announced that flights at places like Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Connecticut were all cancelled till Monday, oh. </seg>

<seg id="58"> Well, for New York people, most of their usual Sunday activities were also cancelled.  Oh, few people went outdoors, that is, everyone stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Uh-huh. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What gives people headaches is how they are supposed to go to work on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="61"> In addition, the clear snow, the accumulated snow may cause some flooding. </seg>
<seg id="62"> So, the governments in these affected areas in the US are studying how to deal with the rushing crowds of commuters and cars on their way to work on Monday. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at a few Japan-related news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan's Defense Agency to a ministry, so as to increase Japan's military strength. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, along the way, this process has aroused a lot of controversy and undergone many twists and turns. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, some project bid-rigging scandals broke out in the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan's Defense Agency, causing some current and former officials to be arrested by authorities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As a result, quite a few people advised Koizumi to be careful about upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, recently Koizumi said that he would shelve this plan and would not submit it to the Diet for review for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, he also hopes the two governing parties can carefully discuss this issue and continue, er, consultations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On another note, if you go to Japan, there is now a new regulation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> That is, Japan plans, stipulates that most tourists and travelers to Japan must have their fingerprints scanned and photographs taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is a way of preventing some dangerous people from entering Japanese territory, and in addition, of guarding against illegal immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, so, going to Japan should now be even more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, of course, recently there has also been a piece of good news in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That is, Princess Kiko, wife of Japan's Prince Akishinomiya, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The event makes many Japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful Imperial Household. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Er, in fact Kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman.  Moreover, people have always thought she was satisfied with a four-member family. </seg>
<seg id="17"> To be pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help speculating that er, this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the Imperial Household. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, it is like this.  When the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito suffered from depression in 2002, the Imperial Household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on Prince Fumihito. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At that time, Fumihito did not respond much to this. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But by 2004, the conflict had become somewhat intense, because Naruhito, eager to protect his wife, criticized the Imperial Household in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, it is said that the Imperial Household at that time was furious and asked Prince Fumihito, who is of the same generation, to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the Imperial Household while spoiling his own wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The two brothers have not been on good terms since. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, now if a boy is born to Prince Fumihito, then they, as core members, will become a pillar of the Imperial Household. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Meanwhile, the Eastern Palace, that is, the elder prince, would surely decline as a result. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Er, so, quite a number of people think that if this is the case, it will have a great impact on the Imperial Household and Japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="1"> On Monday UN Secretary General Annan went to the White House to meet with US President Bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> With regard to Iran's announcement of its postponement of nuclear talks with Russia, Annan urged Iran to stop nuclear activities as soon as possible and resolve the issue through negotiations instead of confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition, some sources said that the US Defense Department has actually already started planning for an intensive bombing on Iran as a last resort should diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, outsiders think that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, but the two did not publicize any discussion in this regard after their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Both Bush and Annan reiterated their hope that the Iran nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed his concern that Iran started uranium enrichment and decided to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, US media reports said that military tactic experts from the Pentagon have already started planning for an intensive military action so that the US will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons by military means should diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports, the commander of the US Central Command is making decisions on the targets of attacks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> There may be a submarine-launched ballistic missile strike or air strikes by B-2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On Monday, Annan called upon all parties involved not to take any action that may escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Some military experts analyzed that Iran may acquire the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And there are more than two years left from Bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will try to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term whether by peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Mo Naiqian reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Iranian President Ahmadinejad said on the 13th that superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that arms race and competition for hegemony among various countries in the world will achieve nothing. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The greed of super powers can never be satisfied.  They even threaten other countries with their weapons. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, he said that these super powers that rely on their weapons to bully other countries will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind enjoys eternal peace and stability will soon come. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So, we can see this is not merely a battle of words now.  In fact, the mounting tensions between Iran and the West are indeed becoming more and more intense. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Well, since Iran and the US are making no concession to each other in their positions, recently there have also been some format changes.  That is, Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume their uranium enrichment programs. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some Western diplomats speculated that they might have actually resumed some procedures for uranium enrichment prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Iran also announced that it would postpone its talks with Russia indefinitely.  That is, the talks on Russia refining uranium for Iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, of course, the indefinite postponement of the talks was also decided based on this new situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Well, recently, since the US continues to threaten Iran with attacks, the Oxford Research Institute, a UK think tank, issued this report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the US really wants to use force, then half of the people will be dead because of that.  In addition, it will of course trigger, um, may keep this year's wave of violence in the Middle East going on. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Besides, some terrorist attacks will also escalate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, oil prices will also soar, which is also one of the series of Domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Furthermore, this report said that if the US fails to subdue Iran, Iran will surely speed up its determination to manufacture nuclear weapons on its own. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Well, we just mentioned the issue of the Russian-Iranian talks. </seg>
<seg id="32"> An Iranian government spokesperson indeed said on Monday that due to the new situation, it would postpone its talks with Russian officials scheduled for the 16th on uranium enrichment in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="33"> However, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that no official notification from Iran was received yet. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So, it is still yet too early to tell whether the meeting will be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency Director Kuchinov said on Monday that Russia is ready to have talks with Iran on the conditions and principle of the negotiations over the nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> At the same time, the US New York Times recently published an editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The title of this editorial is also very conspicuous.  It is called Japan's Offensive Foreign Minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Well, this editorial specifically mentioned that Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso recently made a string of appalling remarks. </seg>
<seg id="4"> These remarks were all very dishonest and very unwise.  Furthermore, the remarks have triggered widespread indignation among Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, this editorial also specifically mentioned that Japan should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lesson rather than avoid mentioning in post-WW II textbooks some of their deeds during the war as they are doing right now. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the editorial also said that many of Taro Aso's current remarks, for instance, requesting the prime minister to visit Yasukuni Shrine, for instance, saying Taiwanese colonial rule raised, um, ah, the Japanese colonial rule raised Taiwan's educational level, and so on, it said such remarks were all very appalling.  Moreover, it is evident that he has no knowledge of history and is a very poor diplomat too. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Since the New York Times was the third largest newspaper in circulation in the United States last year, it should be very influential in the US society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As a result, such an editorial should also be very influential. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the meantime, some former senior US government officials and some US experts on Asian issues, they recently held a special forum, that is, a forum on Sino-Japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Well, at this forum, some experts put forward this viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It said that as current Sino-Japanese relations are under great tensions, there may be potential danger of military conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, it even said that now there is a greater possibility of a military conflict breaking out between China and Japan than between China and Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, moreover, once the military conflict breaks out, it will surely drag the US into it because the US will surely get involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also participating in the forum said that Sino-Japanese relations are now indeed under great tensions. </seg>
<seg id="15"> So, any mistake will lead to serious consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On another note, the Georgian parliament's Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping force from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Russian parliament will hold a general assembly to review this bill today. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Er, experts think that if the parliament agrees to expel the Russian peacekeeping force, it may lead to the complete breakup of Georgian-Russian ties. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two of the Russian peacekeeping contingent's military vehicles transporting foods were intercepted by Georgian police with the driver expelled. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, the spokesperson called for Georgia to stop immediately such provocations; otherwise Russia would assume no responsibility for the consequences of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Two military vehicles belonging to the logistic system of the Russian peacekeeping contingent transporting foods and groceries were examined by Georgian police Monday night in Georgia's South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Georgian law enforcement personnel on duty expelled the Russian driver and escorting personnel and forcibly drove away the two military vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident greatly angered the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1, Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the area on an excuse of a traffic accident and has not returned it so far. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, three Russian military officers were detained for two days and nights on grounds of visa problems. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Georgia's reckless provocations were aimed to incur bloodshed in the area by forcing the Russian troops to open fire so that it could achieve the goal of the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="27"> On that day, the Russian embassy in Georgia made serious representations to the Georgian side, demanding Georgia to immediately stop frenzied provocations; otherwise the Russian side will not assume any consequence of the resulting conflict. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The media noted that on February 13, Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold several Strela portable air defense missile systems to South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On that day, the Georgian parliament Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting to hear a report by the law enforcement agency.  It decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping troops in Georgia and called for a review of this issue at the general assembly on the 14th. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Experts think that the final decision, once passed, may eventually lead to the complete breakup of Georgian-Russian ties. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Earlier, Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and refuted Russian President Putin's remark that Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia should the West recognize Kosovo.  He thinks that Russian authorities are sending an encouraging signal to all secessionist districts. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Russian Foreign Ministry also announced earlier that it would protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia, implying a direct threat of military force to Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> US Pacific Fleet Commander Roughead announced on Tuesday that this summer the United States will deploy four aircraft carriers to conduct the largest-ever military exercise in the Asia-Pacific region in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead also said that the United States will, er, not consider, um, China, ah, a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The US military is hoping to have another joint exercise with China's PLA Navy. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This declaration of position immediately drew the attention of US defense experts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Heritage Foundation, a US think tank, held a forum on the Pentagon defense review report on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The subtle relationship between the defense report and the military exercise has become one of the focuses of discussion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some, however, think that Roughead's open invitation of China to participate in the military exercise was a sign of US friendship to China. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since the US military also expressed hope for more transparency in China's PLA operations while inviting China to participate in the military exercise, some defense experts think that this shows the Pentagon's hope to sound each other out through the joint military exercise because it is not sure about the purpose of China's military expansion. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In addition, since the defense review report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of this month considered China the greatest potential threat, the two defense experts also pointed out that the Asia-Pacific military exercise is the first step that the US Department of Defense takes to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xie Xiaoshuang reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, this time, this US military exercise in summer is drawing quite a lot of attention, because this is also, ah, the first time in a decade that the US has four aircraft carriers, ah, to participate jointly in a military exercise.  It is also the first time after the Vietnam War that the US deployed the aircraft carriers off the East Coast to do such a military exercise in this west Pacific Ocean region. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, this military exercise, ah, is actually very frequent, taking place four times in a few months. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, these also include a multinational military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, this multinational military exercise, ah, includes Japan, ah, South Korea, and Australia. </seg>

<seg id="35"> In addition, Hu Jintao also expressed deep condolences on the tragic death of the Chinese personnel and expressed sincere sympathy for the families of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="36"> All right, regarding this issue, let's now connect with Chen Yiming, People's Daily correspondent in Islamabad, to find out the latest development. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Hello, Mr. Chen. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Please brief us on the latest development of the investigation of the shooting death of the Chinese engineers. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Er, yes, host. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Er, according to what I have learned from the Chinese consulate general in Karachi, er, the Chinese embassy and consulate has already informed the victims' work unit of this tragic incident. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Well, according to the general practice, um, the work unit of the victims should be consulting with the families before making any final decision as to how to deal with the aftermath. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In addition, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry also issued a statement yesterday. </seg>

<seg id="45"> Er, in addition, according to the report by Pakistan's private-run GEO on the evening of the 15th, Bashir, chief executive officer of the Attock cement factory in Pakistan, said in his interview with the station this evening that following the attack, the Pakistani side will try to arrange for the remaining 11 Chinese engineering and technical personnel working on the construction site of the cement project to return to their country as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Well, um, Bashir also said in the interview that with regard to the question of some Pakistani media why the Chinese engineers did not have security guards with them when the incident took place, er, he said, er, actually the cement factory where these engineers worked has its own security system; however, since the incident occurred within the boundary of the factory, none of security guards were with them at the time. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Well, he expressed deep regrets about the occurrence of this tragic incident. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Host. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Eh, all right. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Er, besides, it is actually not the first time that Chinese engineering personnel were killed in attacks in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Such an incident occurred in October 2004. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in South Waziristan. </seg>
<seg id="53"> In the end, one of them unfortunately died during the rescue mission. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In addition, three engineering personnel also died in a bombing attack in Gwadar in May of the same year. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Let's have a recap. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On May 3, 2004, in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, a vehicle carrying 12 Chinese was hit by a car bomb while it was driving to the port construction site. </seg>
<seg id="57"> In the end three Chinese engineering personnel died, while nine people were wounded. </seg>
<seg id="58"> This attack was believed to be launched by local separatists and tribal militias. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in South Waziristan where Pakistan borders Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> When Pakistani troops came to the rescue of the hostages later, one engineer was unfortunately shot to death. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, armed groups linked with al-Qaeda rather than separatist militants were believed to be responsible for this hostage incident. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Since China has a close economic exchange with Pakistan and participates in Pakistan's infrastructure construction, quite a number of Chinese engineering personnel are working there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Yet, tribal militias in Pakistan accused the government of robbing them of their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Consequently, Chinese people have fallen victims several times to attacks and abductions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at a few Japan-related news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Recently there has been a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese political circles. </seg>
<seg id="3"> That is, Tsuneo Watanabe, chairman of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the number one in the Japanese media, he ordered the Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine.  Furthermore, the Yomiuri Shimbun has since taken a position against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Er, well, um, Tsuneo Watanabe, he was lashing out against Koizumi in his speech a few days ago, saying he is very ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the same time he also said that visiting Yasukuni Shrine is like singing praises of Hitler.  In addition, he said that by doing so, Koizumi also made China and South Korea consider Japan a very dangerous country.  This is going to have no end of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, why could Tsuneo Watanabe, his attitude trigger great impact? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Actually, he is also very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Yet, he used to be a very rightist figure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We should say he had always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But now, ah, this is really a big turn. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He now directed his attacks against Koizumi and started to oppose such a stance. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually in 2004 when someone attacked Koizumi for visiting Yasukuni Shrine, um, Tsuneo Watanabe, he still said, he said, er, he supported him and wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, he gave a speech recently.  He said, I am already more than 80 years old and don't have much time left. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, he has now adopted a high-sounding tone and taken on a kind of highly anti-war stance in his speech. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This kind of changing sides by him, of course, has a great social impact in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just like Tsuneo Watanabe said himself, he said, I firmly believe I have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Furthermore, he also said that should the Yomiuri Shimbun's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure, he would resist it at the risk of his life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Well, what kind of situation has it come to now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> That is, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest newspaper in Japan, and the Asahi Shimbun, the second largest newspaper in Japan, now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, these two large newspapers were opponents, but later when the two chairmen met, they at least reached consensus on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As a result, they now both launched massive attacks on Koizumi, forming what we could call a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Actually, these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on Japanese mainstream public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition, let's look at the meeting of Japan's House of Representatives.  At one of their recent meetings, two relatively popular candidates for successor to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same remark. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who are these two people? </seg>
<seg id="25"> One is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso, who has made a series of appalling remarks recently. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What remarks did these two make? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They said that Japan's WWII criminals were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they meant was, er, it was the international court that has called them criminals and convicted them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Whereas, in Japan, according to the international law, they were; according to the domestic law in Japan, er, the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of Japan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, they think that WWII criminals should not be considered criminals in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, um, Shinzo Abe, he also mentioned that Japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with, um, some east Asian countries.  In addition, it should also try its best to develop close ties with India.  It should not always focus on China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Championship Hopeful but not Assured </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Love Life, Love Luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The fire will soon be lit on the battlefield of the Chinese Super League. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Luneng Taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The fight for the championship among Dalian, Shandong, and Shanghai is on the verge of breaking out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Who will win the championship in the end? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on an analysis of strength, although the Taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship, it is not 100 percent assured. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, new team members have little time to get adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Taishan team had four major openings last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This year, following recruitment of the two famous national football players Li Leilei and Wang Liang, the Taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players.  Its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, since the national team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq, there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates. </seg>
<seg id="12"> By the time they return to the team, the Super League will be starting. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Therefore, the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the Taishan team now faces. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In my opinion, the national football players can serve as substitutes in the first few Super League matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Second, it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After sharpening their skills in several matches, it will not be too late to enter the battle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The next problem is the hidden troubles on defense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Last year, the Taishan team's defense was criticized by football fans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This year, defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of Li Leilei, but it's not yet time to rest easy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The central back still has a problem with turning around slowly, while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If the central back can put forth a stable performance this year, then the Taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think it may be a good idea to use Ren Yongshun, who is in good physical shape.  Despite insufficient experience, he can test himself this year and prepare for the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, it is also fine to recall Gao Yao to play sweeper. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There are quite a few members of the Taishan team who can play defensive midfield.  Both Cui Peng and Haibin can play. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Yao, who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball, should be able to do a good job as central back. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Also, whether the foreign players can adjust themselves... </seg>
<seg id="28"> Issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the Taishan team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Last year, Danciulescu's performance left much to be desired. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that this year, in addition to recruiting an excellent striker, a pure left midfielder should be recruited. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except for Xing Rui a few years ago, the Taishan team has not had a single true left-footed specialist. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although Cui Peng and others are all competent, however, a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand-in. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three problems can be resolved well, the road to the championship for the Taishan team should be a bit smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Shandong football fan, I hope very much that the Taishan team will win the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, to be honest, based on this year's competitive situation, the Taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Hello, everyone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Once again Spring Festival is behind us.  Our friends who combined their vacation days with Spring Festival holidays are returning to their work. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Wish all friends a Happy New Year, if it is still not too late to say Happy New Year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> When I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe the other day, he mentioned the current BrandVista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The website has become much prettier. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The layout of the content is pretty good. </seg>
<seg id="9"> What he likes most is still the recent fully revamped Discuz-based community BBS. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Speaking of the community, I will have to thank one person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> That is Mr. Li Mingshun, general manager of Discuz Beijing company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If you search for his name on Google, you can get a lot of hits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I roughly know that he used to be at Sina and later started his own business, an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium-sized businesses, similar to adbrite.com abroad. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At that time he debated on MSN to the effect that Vista thinks that the development of many sectors in China all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium-sized businesses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, the situation in this respect in China's markets now is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium-sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he came to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is an excellent community software based on PHP and MySQL database. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer in Beijing, the BrandVista community finally saw hope again and emerged with a brand-new look. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The feedback is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The interface is clean-cut and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The speed is quite fast. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Writing some texts inspirational both to myself and to others on a freshly clean-cut interface and exchanging details in my work and life with friends of the same aspiration working in the same industry, I started to think this is a kind of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thanks, Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> There has been quite a lot of news lately in the advertising sector. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Starting from January, the WTO regulations on the liberalization of advertising went into effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Large foreign companies have been arriving at the scene, while smaller foreign companies are getting ready.  Prosperity seems to be everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Batey Advertising, which originated in Singapore, has encountered quite a lot of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="30"> After losing several heavyweight clients in a row and suffering a series of setbacks in its development in mainland China, Sir Martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in Italy to think about reshuffling his cards. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Batey Advertising, Batey will merge with the JWT network while keeping its brand name under the JWT management. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In the meantime, there is rumor that Bates and the 141 network will soon merge with OgilvyOne and will be managed by the OgilvyOne ad network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Though 141 earlier reported it to OgilvyOne, it would be interesting for Bates Asia to report it to OgilvyOne. </seg>
<seg id="34"> During the Spring Festival several articles have been updated on the website.  I will not go into details here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> You may go check them out on the website if you have time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, those friends who have not entered the new forum may as well make an extra click to access the brand-new community at BrandVista </seg>
<seg id="37"> to experience the environment and atmosphere as well as to contribute some texts. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Hope you will feel the happiness of finding where you belong. </seg>

<seg id="3"> I saw this article and want to share it with you. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is not out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I asked myself how I would act if it were me. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The answer was very clear.  I would put down the phone with a "You dialed a wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> I have been thinking this year what exactly can be considered helping others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Two days ago, a friend said, I have already no time to take care of myself.  Even if I want to help others, I will not have the energy to do it. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wish you a pleasant day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mom Ten Years Ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> On that day ten years ago, when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break, the telephone rang suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She picked up the phone and listened, yet out came a strange rough voice: "We have caught your kid stealing a book.  Come here quick!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> Coming from the other end of the line was a little girl's crying， along with loud scolding voices of others. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Glancing over at her only daughter, who was watching TV nearby, it suddenly dawned upon her. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Obviously, a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book.  As she did not want to let her family know it, she must have made up a phone number at random.  That was how they happened to call here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call.  She could also even reprimand the other party, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this incident had nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, being a teacher, she thought she might be her own student. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl, who made the momentary slip, must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hesitating for a moment, an idea suddenly occurred to her.  Right, just do it this way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So, after making sure about the bookstore's address, she hurried there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Just as she expected, a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore, </seg>
<seg id="25"> while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms.  Turning around, she said to the sales person nearby: "Talk to me.  Don't scare the kid." </seg>
<seg id="27"> Amid the sales person's reluctant mutterings, she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear-smudged, terrified face. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She laughed and took the little girl home.  She gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Before she took off, she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly, if you want to read books, just come to the auntie's place.  There are many books inside. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The little girl, who had still not yet recovered from her horror, took a close look at her and scampered away.  She never reappeared. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time went by like a rushing stream.  Ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Having long forgotten this thing, she still lived here, leading a quiet and peaceful life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One day at noon, there was a series of knocks on the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When she opened the door, she saw a stranger, a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> She asked doubtfully. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In her excitement, that girl said a great deal. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl, a stranger to her, did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year.  She had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With her eyes glistening with tears, the young girl said softly: "Though I have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out, I have always felt all these ten years that I want to call you mom." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes also grew blurry. </seg>
<seg id="41"> She asked curiously: "If I had not helped you, what would have happened?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> The girl's face immediately darkened.  She gently shook her head and said: "I am not sure.  I could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The teacher's heart trembled, and she started to feel rejoiced secretly. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The decision she made on the spur of the moment that year turned out to have had such an impact on one person's life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smile on the girl's face, she also smiled. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Observation on Military Situation: How Long Would Iran be Able to Hold on Against US Military Air Strikes? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death, then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy's head at the outset, turning it into a "vegetable" with no time to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The difference between Iran and the US in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The British International Intelligence Review recently mentioned, after analyzing US military deployments, that US troops are preparing to launch a large-scale air strike on Iran... </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current status of the Iranian Air Force is rather worrisome. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The current status of the Iranian Air Force is very similar to the pre-war Iraqi Air Force in 2003. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently and is also under the arms embargo imposed by the West. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Upon the breakout of war, it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the Iranian Air Force could take off and fight the US military. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Currently, Iran's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land-based air defense force of Iran's regular military as well as the air defense force of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Among these, the Iranian Air Force is currently about 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The main plane models are US-made F-4 Phantoms, F-5 Tigers, and F-14 Tomcats, and Russian-made MIG-29s, among others. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The land-based air defense forces are mainly equipped with US-made Hawk, British-made Arrow, and some Russian-made Sam series surface-to-air missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Analyzing the current status of the Iranian air defense forces, Harold Hutchinson, a US military expert, Khramchikhin, a military expert at Russia's Institute of Political and Military Analysis, and others think that looking at the current situation, there are still some holes in Iran's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power, the Iranian Air Force is absolutely not at the same level as the US military. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The large number of US-made fighter planes Iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts, upgrades, and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of the F-14 fighters, once considered the trump of the Iranian Air Force, currently only 10-plus can take off. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is also questionable whether the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles that they carry, which are said to have over-the-horizon attack capability, are reliable in actual battle. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the US provided to Iran in the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some other non-system air defense weapons acquired from Russia and other countries are no match for the US military, which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Scraping it together has an effect on combat power. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies.  In a last-minute effort to update its weaponry, it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From what can be seen at present, its methods can be summarized into two. </seg>
<seg id="25"> First, work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to a report by the British newspaper the Times, Iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the Natanz nuclear plant and Isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2-meter thick cement protection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> However, the US military is a step ahead, having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 Gulf war in defending against air strikes, it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After more than ten years of targeted research, the US military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the end of last year, the Iranian government has made successive agreements with Russia to purchase the Pechora-2A air defense missile system, along with 29 sets of the Tor-M1 air defense missile system worth 700 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, modern warfare is a competition between systems. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The various air strike weapons of the US military were all developed independently by their own country.  Furthermore, after years of real war experience, they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In contrast, whether the "new weapons" Iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Iran is not lagging behind in weapons only. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The Army Field Manual published by the US military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of "Air Land Battle," which emphasizes attacking the enemy's deeply strategic and high-value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than "meat on the chopping board" no matter how powerful its regular military strength. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War, and the 2003 Iraq War, the US military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Although the Iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities, Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Along with the US military's progress in recent years in military transformation work, the US military's air strike operations already completely differ from Vietnam War era carpet bombing, depending instead on various kinds of high-tech weapons and on modern information technology-based high precision and full depth air attacks. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Confronted with such air strikes, it is still unknown how long Iran's land-based air defense system would be able to hold on. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Joining Hands with Google in Battling Microsoft, Dell Charges Software Vendors "Shelving fees?" </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Yun Feiquan </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dell Inc. (US: DELL) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is testing personal computers that have installed Google Pack. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This move may pose a severe threat against Microsoft's (MSFT) dominant position in the PC software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Dell press spokesman Jess Blackburn indicated that the company is evaluating Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After installing this software, PC users can use the software to search the web as well as search for information stored on the PC. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn confirmed that at this time, the software being tested by the company include a Google-supported Dell homepage, Google Desktop Search, and Google Toolbar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, Google press spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that his company and Dell were testing a bundle of software developed by Google. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that IT upstart Google was in the process of negotiations with Dell and Hewlett-Packard Co., among others, in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include Google software in their PCs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to insider sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal, Google may pay up to 1 billion US dollars to Dell over the next three years to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the two companies did not reveal any of the relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, Hewlett Packard refused to comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Microsoft press spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news. </seg>
<seg id="14"> As of now, Microsoft is planning to release its next-generation Windows operating system search tool and boost its development of web services. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the day the news was released, Google's stock price again dropped by 4.46% to 367.92 US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft's stock price fell this day by 1%, closing at 26.94 US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts pointed out that Google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search.  Joining hands with PC giants such as Dell may cause Google to threaten Microsoft's core business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Matt Rosoff, an analyst from market research firm Directions on Microsoft, indicated that Google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources, which is definitely something Microsoft is concerned about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, some analysts are rather unimpressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Charles Di Bona, an analyst from market analysis firm Sanford C. Bernstein, pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows' dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reporter's note: Google Shaking Microsoft's Throne? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Huizhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> Computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in their life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, while everybody uses a computer skillfully, only a handful of people actually know the operating principle of a computer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Just as using a "foolproof" camera, as long as the interface is friendly and software is easy to use, most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Therefore, PC's manufacturer-installed original software will often determine the usage habits of most consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is exactly through this measure that Microsoft commands a solid control of the PC operating system market. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Now, Google, Microsoft's new rival, also intends to have its finger in the pie through this means. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A well-known economics media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Dell, Hewlett Packard, and other computer manufacturers started to treat their computer products as supermarket shelves and charge software companies "shelving fees." </seg>
<seg id="31"> Winning bidders can have their software appear in the 'critical ten minutes' when users start their new computers so as to guide consumers to use their products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This mode of charging fees resembles the way supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees." </seg>
<seg id="33"> Doubtlessly, this phenomenon indicates Microsoft's control is being loosened. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Microsoft's managers warned Bill Gates that if Google began to pay PC manufacturers to have their computers installed with Google software when they are shipped out, then Microsoft's hegemony will eventually be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> No matter what will be the outcome of the situation, Microsoft's stable and easy days as number one may become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, it is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Sword of Justice: Prospects for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: Sword of Justice </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember that at the beginning of 2005, Hong Kong's Apple Daily published an article entitled "As Falun Wheel Revolves, its Contributions Rival Those of Government." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article called 2004 a year of great advancement for Falun Gong. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article gave many examples of how overseas CPC officials completely lost their manners in suppressing Falun Gong on various occasions, while Falun Gong practitioners told the truth all over the world, making the CPC completely lose face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the "Nine Commentaries" in 2005, the year 2004 did not seem impressive. </seg>
<seg id="9"> -Well, what will things be like in 2006? </seg>
<seg id="10"> From two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year, we can probably see some clues about this year's developments. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One is the publication of "Eliminating Evils" by the Falun Gong founder.  This article announced the imminent doom of those who became CPC spies after July 20, 1999. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Yet, whether believing it or not, history and facts will be the proof! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, CPC spies are like rats living in the sewer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their "natural or accidental" deaths won't rouse social or public attention. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by CPC spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the CPC power structure. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination, they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party, defection, or counterattack. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Consequently, "the CPC ultra stable bureaucracy group" maintained by filthy interests will start to shake, crumble, and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> Another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by Gao Zhisheng to safeguard human rights. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This movement, which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning, on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world, and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses, making it a widespread success, then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable, evil CPC regime. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If we say 2005 was a year in which the CPC was destroyed spiritually, then 2006 will begin a phase in which the CPC will be eliminated both spiritually and materially. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With the further spread of the "Nine Commentaries" and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party, with the internal collapse of the CPC and the convergence of external forces of justice, the life of the CPC devil will officially enter the count-down period. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The intent of heaven and the people is harmonious; the power of God and the people are converging. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The giant sword is pointing directly at the CPC devil. </seg>
<seg id="26"> If we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a year of surging momentum, then what will be the final conclusion for 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it is stunning transformation and triumph! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Subject: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, Linyi Municipal Party Committee Secretary - Hooliganism May Also Harm Yourself </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mailing station: feel like old friends at the first meeting (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this station (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> As of yesterday the Linyi government under your leadership had illegally put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You people have cut off the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You people have also beat him and his family members several times. </seg>
<seg id="11"> You people's barbarism has exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In early October 2005, you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat Attorney Li Fangping and me, but we put up with it, always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in.  We even acquiesced for some time after you people put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, 165 days have passed.  Instead of refraining yourself, you people even have become more unscrupulous. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You people continued to detain and beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You people have gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in Chen Guangcheng, I remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Things at the very beginning should have warranted your reconsideration. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Family planning in Linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, you were wrong to think that people in Linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government's action? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time? </seg>
<seg id="24"> If the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd, don't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the Chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the Constitution? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why don't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your Linyi alone dare do such things? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How could it be that your Linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law? </seg>
<seg id="27"> After Chen Guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law, after Teng Biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens' rights got involved, and after the National Family Planning Commission made the conclusion of the investigation, Linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After all, family planning is a tough subject with Chinese characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="29"> People could also have understood your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Yet, you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back to be locked up.  You even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> In fact, as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job, would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him? </seg>
<seg id="34"> On October 4, 2005, Attorney Li Fangping and I went to Dongshigu Village.  We made our position very clear and hoped to resolve the contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We proposed that we could talk with your officials first to find out what idea and request you people had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We offered to help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to make certain remarks. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It was our hope that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, your policy makers were bent on having your way, and furthermore, even "masterminded" an incident of beating and illegally detaining us. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think you can scare us this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We have not done anything illegal. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We are not afraid of anything. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Although the rule of law in China is imperfect, it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="43"> If you think you can scare us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society, then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As long as we want, we have many people who have many lawful reasons to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat attorneys and scholars once, twice, and three times.  Each time there will be widespread attention and coverage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you people dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Don't you care very much about your official position? </seg>
<seg id="48"> In case someone is injured by beating, is your position really that secure? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice, don't you think this is not only foolish but also risky? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to tell you clearly that in China there is a large number of excellent citizens who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We are not afraid of hooligans and the underground society. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you are going to the extreme, we will go toward your batons and sticks with confidence and ease in groups and by turns until the moment you retreat. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Don't think you can extricate yourself from those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Finally, I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Blind since a child, he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and English.  He once sued the Beijing subway company in the interest of the blind people, and he introduced running water for the villagers.  He is known far and wide as "Attorney Chen." </seg>
<seg id="58"> You people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients.  Don't you think you have gone too far by doing that? </seg>
<seg id="59"> It is illegal for you people to put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest.  It is also risky to you. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Originally, you people could have released him with no trouble. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Since the barbarous implementation of the law has stopped, how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked? </seg>
<seg id="62"> But, you people are now continuing to smear your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> As long as Cheng Guangcheng is not free, you people will never have peace. </seg>
<seg id="64"> You people have tortured him enough. </seg>
<seg id="65"> If you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism, we will never look on with folded arms. </seg>

<seg id="3"> I am very disappointed to admit that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Aren't the people posting here doing just that? </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is just a pity that not many people will read it online (compared with 1.4 billion). </seg>
<seg id="6"> Among netizens, even fewer people are concerned with or participate in topics like this.  I dare say it is less than 1% of netizens! </seg>
<seg id="7"> What's more, this network is equipped with the Golden Shield, the world's largest, most comprehensive, most advanced, most expensive, and highest quality project! </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Depressed, disappointed, helpless, even thinking of submission, but if I want to live a human life, who else can I count on but myself to make it happen? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Though man proposes, God disposes; even if I failed...I would think that it is my fault and that I deserve to live like a dog if I have not tried hard for my own ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own life, at least in my own heart, in my self-appraisal. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact I don't have to worry about the future of China at all. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is just a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I only lament that the Chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history, they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you.  Just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road, and even force us to be proud of such glory. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Dark night falls everywhere, but it is the longest in the Divine Land of China. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Qin Emperor plus the sage Confucius brought huge disasters to people. </seg>
<seg id="18"> While the First Qin Emperor openly ruled as a tyrant, the sage Confucius brainwashed in the shadows. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is not that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy, it is that their democracy gene is gone, having been made to regress. </seg>
<seg id="20"> For a nation that has existed for more than three thousand years, this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture. </seg>
<seg id="21"> When a democratic system was established in Athens, when a republic was founded in Rome, when the Magna Carta was approved by the British people, when the French people were issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and when Americans were issuing the Declaration of Independence, what were Chinese people doing? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the Mongols took control of the Central Plains, khuriltai were used to elect emperors.  The Manchus long ago had the Council of Princes and Ministers to practice democratic administration.  Why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the Han people? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Chinese pursue material things and are not interested at all in spiritual beliefs and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Believe it or not, at the price of a stuffed pancake, Chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> After half a million years, if the Chinese want democracy, the earthquake will surely be coming.  Run if you can! </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dalai's special envoys meet with Chinese officials behind closed doors. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Dalai Lama stressed that he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The special envoys of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in exile, are having closed-door meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing with no details released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth official meeting between China and the Dalai's government-in-exile since contacts resumed in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, as always, the two sides met behind close doors with no details revealed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in northern India, said that he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Chinese side refused to comment on the bilateral talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, analysts said that Beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that Tibetans' dissatisfaction with the Chinese rule may escalate should this 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile die. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural Identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> The delegation of Dalai's government-in-exile was led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was also chief representative to several previous talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesperson for the Tibetan government-in-exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very "close and frank," bringing hopes for Tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesperson said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the Chinese leadership so that Tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity, which they consider important. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Dalai Lama's Special Envoys Reiterate they do not Seek Tibet's Independence. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Dalai Lama will go to visit Washington this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Prior to the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama's visit to the United States on November 8, his special envoys said that the Tibetan government-in-exile would not demand for Tibet's independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hoped the Chinese government would indeed preserve Tibet's unique culture and tradition. </seg>
<seg id="21"> During his visit to the US next week, the Dalai Lama is expected to discuss the Tibetan issue with President Bush in hopes that Bush can urge the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Dalai's representative had direct contact with Beijing officials for the first time in Berne in July of this year. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "Genuine Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that in recent years the Tibetan government-in-exile has seen some positive aspects when meeting with Chinese authorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Dalai Lama's special envoys found that Beijing leaders, especially the representatives from the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, were more willing than before to hear their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that the Tibetan government-in-exile still has too many disagreements with the Chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that during the past five years the Tibetan government-in-exile has tried its best to meet the Chinese request for creating a good negotiation environment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> China should also create a good environment for negotiations on the Tibetan issue instead of suppressing the Dalai Lama unrelentingly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said that the Dalai Lama does not demand independence for Tibet.  Tibet is still part of China, but the Chinese government must preserve Tibet's unique culture so that "Tibetans will have genuine autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> In addition, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that some Chinese think the Tibetan issue will disappear once the Dalai Lama dies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said that this idea is very dangerous because China will lose a historic opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue once the Dalai Lama passes away. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the requests of the Dalai Lama and proposes a final resolution, the Dalai Lama will not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Negotiation And Compromise are Important Democratic Methods! (ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I just saw a post by a net friend on The Great Spirit: To Old Mr. Guiren. </seg>
<seg id="4"> His/her original words were "negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods, or else, splitting because of disagreements is the failure of democracy!!!  I hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> This bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At this time, I thought of ancient China as well as the past of the West. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Seldom posting topics, I could not help replying to the post of this net friend in the form of a topic post. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's take a look first at ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everybody knows that beginning with the First Qin Emperor, China has constructed a large and unified centralized power system, with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although a "double-track system" was temporarily implemented in the Han Dynasty, that is, a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system, after all, there was still a centralized power system in the end. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side, had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity, initiative, and activity in local areas, making it even less possible to formulate, based on local conditions, various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The pyramid-like system of government also caused lower-level officials to only look upward, following every detail of orders from higher levels. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government, they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves, let alone with those ordinary citizens. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When their rights were infringed upon, peasants in ancient China could do nothing but put up with it time and again. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Only when their most basic rights were threatened, that is, when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine, tyranny, and natural disasters, would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over 2,000 years, several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country, from the spontaneous Chen Sheng Wu Guang Uprising to the plotted Yellow Turban Uprising, to the Huang Chao Riot in the Tang Dynasty, as well as the one-month dynastic rule as a result of Li Zicheng's uprising.  Except for Zhu Yuanzhang, none achieved victory in the true sense of the word. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty established this way by Zhu Yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties, with no change in the system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Born a commoner with little education, Zhu Yuanzhang implemented ancient China's centralized power system to a sickening extreme.  The brimming vitality characteristic of the Tang Dynasty, born of openness, freedom, and tolerance, was replaced by stagnant lifelessness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of China for some time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Human nature suffered utmost suppression. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much, from fear and trepidation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the Chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now let's take a look at the Middle Ages in Western Europe, known as the Dark Ages. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after Western Rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient Greece and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This period was characterized by fiefdoms, namely land fiefdoms. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Landlords at lower levels had more independent power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and barons who appeared on formal occasions, as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another, with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king, there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests, scenes never seen in ancient Chinese history. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This way, by means of various kinds of contracts, rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners, and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners, the king's rights became increasingly diminished. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the end, the British queen became only ceremonial, with no actual power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Democracy was gradually realized through this method! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let's come back to make a comparison with ancient China, with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor (except for Li Shimin) and with almost no noblemen.  It would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine, making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under such circumstances, when the right of existence was deprived, the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Consequently, there was a repeated rotation, from the heyday of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparing Chinese history with Western history, we find there seems to be no Western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In no Western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In Western countries, when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose, noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests.  They would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights, while force was rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding this, you will see that even as we enter the 21st century, some democratic "fighters" on the internet, having inherited the idea of the ultra, absolute totalitarian system of the Ming Dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution, these democratic "fighters" can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy, because these people don't understand that negotiation, consultation, and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cao Xiaoming: Who Foots Bill for Enriching Rural Cultural Activities? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> This Spring Festival, this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural China and visit some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural China, I was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at Spring Festival each year, this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called "Revolving Lantern." </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the Three Warring Kingdoms.  The villagers never grew tired of watching it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There were several performing teams for "Revolving Lantern" across the township.  They not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages, creating liveliness through their exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, this year this village no longer organized it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for "Revolving Lantern."  In the past, costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers, yet they are now too worn out to wear. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Asking villagers door to door for money again, nobody wanted to do it.  Similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Without the "Revolving Lantern," the village suddenly became cold and cheerless. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Adults started to play mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Children also started to play poker. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Villagers all said there was nothing going on for this New Year festival. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the New Year celebration in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Meanwhile, gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further.  Winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace.  In particular, a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, gambling-related family disputes frequently occur.  Some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some peasants say they gamble not only during the New Year festival, but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is no place to go if they don't gamble. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is too difficult to organize some cultural activities, to find some fun in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There are neither facilities nor funds, but also there are no people acting as organizers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, in this regard, what Jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population, the Jiangxi provincial government, starting in September of last year, not only implemented "theatrical performances funded by the government, operated by the market, supported by townships, provided for peasant enjoyment," </seg>
<seg id="25"> but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises, so as to bring high-quality cultural products to the rural population. </seg>
<seg id="26"> At the start of the new year, 10 million yuan was again added, bringing the total amount to 100 million yuan for the establishment of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Moreover, the "bills" paid with this special fund are for real benefits: </seg>
<seg id="28"> inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas, with at least four performances per year in each township; </seg>
<seg id="29"> inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to put on movies in rural areas, with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village; </seg>
<seg id="30"> organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics, with at least 2-3 events per year in each township. </seg>
<seg id="31"> From this "purchase inventory list," it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds, but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population.  It has done a real job. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Currently, the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> If the government can do what Jiangxi did to "foot the bill" for enriching rural people's cultural activities, it will be another joy from heaven for peasants. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Furthermore, this "joy" will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them "active" in cultural activities, which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas. </seg>

<seg id="1"> False Alarm: Wang Peirong's Child Almost Got Kidnapped </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> peirongwangsohu@gmail.com </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Wang Peirong's child almost got kidnapped, but it turned out to be a false alarm. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Some time after 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child gave a full account: </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the morning of January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard when she was attending a make-up class in physics in the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The entrance guard told Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men said to the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard, Wang Peirong's child Wang Tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents' quarrel. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now her mother has disappeared.  As we are the leaders at her mother's workplace, we want to go inside the No. 3 Middle School to take away Wang Peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Peirong's child said to the entrance guard that what these three men said were all lies, and she refused to go with these three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With the help of the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard, Wang Peirong's child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child called her mother's leader at noon to investigate this incident, and that leader denied having sent anyone to the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Wang Peirong's child got her father's leader's telephone number from her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Wang Peirong's child said: "Three people came to the No. 3 Middle Scholl and wanted to take me away." </seg>
<seg id="14"> That leader asked: "Why didn't you go with them?" </seg>
<seg id="15"> Wang Peirong's child answered: "I will surely die if I go with them." </seg>
<seg id="16"> After saying that, Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After hearing what Wang Peirong's child said, Wang Peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On January 25, the feedback from the police station was that what Wang Peirong's child had said was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The police station asked the security department of the China University of Mining and Technology whether it had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong's child at the No. 3 Middle School.  The answer was no. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The police station again asked the CUMT security department whether the work unit affiliated with CUMT had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong's child at the No. 3 Middle School.  The answer was another no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The relevant department asked others to tell Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After the incident, the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City took it seriously. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Through the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City as well as the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a false alarm, and the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau has now confirmed:  On January 24, three people including the leader from the School of Science, Wang Peirong's workplace, could not find Wang Peirong by phone.  As they urgently needed to find Wang Peirong (Wang Peirong has so far no idea what that was about), they thought of going to the No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong's child so as to ask whether the child was in Xuzhou. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Heavy Topics:  Why is There Lower Risk to Engage in Corruption while cost of Anti-corruption is Higher? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> With the current cadre mechanism and the anti-corruption mechanism, a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate, he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will,  disregarding how the people close to him feel. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In contrast, when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice, they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Comparing the two: those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now let's look at Iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government had written to the agency requesting the removal of all equipments that monitor Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of the month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Since the IAEA decided to report Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran had announced the termination of all supportive and cooperative measures it had adopted in the nuclear issue, and refused to allow the IAEA to conduct any further surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Speaking on the tension in Iran's nuclear issue, Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov stated in Athens, Greece, on the 6th that the collaboration between Russia and Iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will be the driving force in resolving Iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed on the same day that Russia's proposal to Iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia is still effective. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two parties may hold discussions on this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the same day, Lugar, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, indicated at the UN Headquarters in New York that the United States disagreed with Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Recent reports claimed that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli air force may deliver a heavy blow to Iran's nuclear facilities if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Xinhua News Agency reported that Kislyak, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, stated on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue, assisting Iran to obtain the legitimate right to peacefully develop nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kislyak said that Russia's proposal on a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still effective. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to discuss the issue with Iran soon. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Russia submitted a proposal to Iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia at the end of last December. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The European Union and the United States both indicated that they could accept this compromise plan. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Kong Quan, spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on the 7th that even though the IAEA had reported Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, it had not shifted its responsibility to handle Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus, all parties still have to break the stalemate of Iran's nuclear issue within the IAEA's framework. </seg>
<seg id="18"> According to the IAEA resolution, the agency's Director-General ElBaradei will submit a report on Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The UN Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating the report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We believe this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill its obligations and commitments, but it is not transferring the IAEA's responsibility on handling the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, China has been seeking peaceful resolutions to Iran's nuclear problem through diplomatic channels for some time. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that Zhang Yan, Director-General of China's Department of Arms Control and Disarmament at the Foreign Ministry, had held talks on Iran's nuclear issue with Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and chief negotiator, in Tehran on February 1. </seg>
<seg id="23"> China hopes that Iran will take great stock in the emphasis of the international community and create conditions for a peaceful solution to Iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To solve the Iranian nuclear issue within the IAEA framework serves not only China's interest, but also the interest of all parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Therefore, we again call on the parties concerned in the international community not to quit the diplomatic effort that has been conducted on this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is in the process of establishing the new Palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that the Cabinet list of the new government is ready, except for the Prime Minister candidate. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This had caused various speculations on the Prime Minister candidate. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A senior Hamas official revealed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas plans to nominate al-Khudairi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Islamic University in Gaza and ((businessman)), as the new Prime Minister of the  autonomous government, but the nomination has not been formally presented to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Al-Khudairi, 50, ran in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections as an independent candidate last month with the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Khudairi never mentioned anything relating to violence or anti-Israel in his public address. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, he had mentioned that internal reform is needed for Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A senior delegation from Hamas is currently visiting Cairo to discuss with Egypt the issue of Hamas' establishment of the new Palestinian government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Khaled Mashaal, a member of the delegation, told the press on the 8th that despite the continuous pressure from the international community and some Arab countries, the Palestinian government led and established by Hamas will not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Mashaal also issued a warning to Abbas in his statement not to change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without consulting Hamas. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Mashaal said, "We have not decided who we will name as Prime Minister." </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before Mashaal reiterated the refusal to recognize Israel, Marzuk, another Hamas political leader, stated during an interview with an Egyptian television station that Hamas will never recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but the new government will keep in touch with Israel in all areas since recognizing Israel and dealing with them are two different things. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's residence on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2"> He stated that extremists are exploiting the cartoon incident regarding Mohammed, the founder of Islam, that has developed so far. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He ((said)), "Denmark respects all religions. And we believe in equal rights for everyone. Er, we appeal to the Muslims to exercise restraint and not to resort to violence." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Prime Minister Rasmussen and the Foreign Minister held a press conference at the Prime Minister's residence at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Rasmussen said, </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The violent attacks on several European embassies demonstrate that this is not a matter between the Muslim countries and Denmark alone. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is of utmost importance to my government and the Danish people that we receive widespread international support on this difficult situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We ally with France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We are working in close cooperation with friends and allies in Europe and the United States, as well countries and organizations in the Muslim world. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Just a few minutes ago, US President Bush called me. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The President called to express support and solidarity with Denmark." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Rasmussen said, "We agreed that the way ahead is through dialogue and tolerance, not violence. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And we emphasized that freedom and democracy, and respect for all faiths, are crucial values. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today I want to appeal to all people in the Muslim countries: Let us work together to stop the violent attacks from expanding. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We need to solve this issue through dialogue, not violence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We are today facing a growing global crisis </seg>
<seg id="17"> We saw Danish flags being burned and Danish embassies being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We saw that Danish people were characterized as intolerant people, or as enemies of Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That is incorrect. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Extremists and radicals who seek a clash of cultures to magnify the incident." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Rasmussen stressed, "Denmark and the Danish people are not enemies of Islam or any other religion. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Danes have for generations pursued human rights, democracy, and freedom beyond politics. </seg>

<seg id="30"> Iranian extremists angered by the publishing of the Mohammed cartoons attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again and threw firebombs on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Meanwhile, an Iranian state-run newspaper held a Holocaust cartoon contest in retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The United States condemned the act as an exploitation of the opportunity to strengthen the prolonged presumptuous anti-Israel position of the Iranian President Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="33"> About 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the fence and entered the Danish embassy in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In addition, as many as 300 people threw stones and firebombs outside the compound. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The day before, student members of Iranian hard-line militia groups led several hundred protesters in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The controversial cartoons were first published by the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten last September. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Other European press and three Arab newspapers reprinted the cartoons, one after another. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In a tit-for-tat move, Hamshahri, the most-circulated newspaper in Iran, announced earlier that it will hold a Holocaust cartoon contest. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The action was condemned by countries including the United States. </seg>
<seg id="40"> McCormack, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said he saw the initiative by Iran's largest-selling paper as an extension of Iranian President Ahmadinejad's campaign of virulent anti-Israeli rhetoric. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated US support for freedom of expression throughout the world, including in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he saw no comparison between the plans for a cartoon contest by Hamshahri and the move by Danish media to publish the Mohammed cartoons. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said, "I don't think that anybody would draw any equivalences between, quote/unquote, 'freedom of the press' in Iran and freedom of the press in Western Europe or the United States." </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad once drew widespread criticisms from the United States and other countries for dismissing the Holocaust as a myth and urging the wiping of Israel off the map. </seg>

<seg id="7"> They cannot afford their children's tuition fees, so they are afraid to go to school. </seg>

<seg id="25"> Leung Kwok Hung, the Legco Councilor who supported Attorney Gao Zhicheng's hunger strike, said that the reckless arrest of civil rights protesters by the Chinese Communist Party is an extremely dangerous signal indicating that this regime has no foundation of popular will at all. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That was also the day for Attorney Albert Ho, a Legco Councilor who is preparing to form a civil rights watch group, to go on his once-a-week hunger strike. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided to hand over Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiation with the United States, one of the advocates. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, a spokesman for the Iranian government stated on Monday that it has maintained its policy toward the United States of non-discussion and non-negotiation on its relationship with the other party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said that it was a huge mistake for the West to hand the nuclear issue over to the UN Security Council, showing that the West is blocking Iran's development. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Iran said on Sunday that it will end the cooperation with the IAEA, resume refining enriched uranium, and ban surprise inspections of nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran's attitude toward this issue is quite strong, while the US position is even stronger. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Er, Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, has stressed repeatedly that the use of violence cannot be ruled out in this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, now there is a rumor that the US military is actually executing such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are developing an ultra-large mother of a bomb. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Er, this ultra-large bomb will be used to bombard Iran once the Department of Defense gives the order. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Then, how big is this mother of a bomb? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Allegedly, its weight alone is 30,000 lbs, the equivalent of a double-decker bus. Er, moreover, its volume is huge. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, the development of such a super bomb is mainly for the bombing of Iran's underground facilities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Due to its extremely strong penetrating force, it can penetrate cement and sheet steel, and will probably create a large pit of 60 feet by 0.5 mile, er, and will destroy many underground buildings and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, from what we see, it seems that the United States has actually started to sharpen its weapons or produce bombs at the last moment. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumsfeld claimed that he does not rule out any means in this issue, in resolving Iran's nuclear issue, and forcible means have been put on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the other hand, Iran's nuclear issue, issue continues to aggravate. Well, er, a relevant Iranian official in China said during an interview with our station that Iran will indeed insist on adopting a peaceful negotiation method to cooperate with the international community, er, hoping to alleviate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, he also indicated that Iran will adjust the content of the nuclear cooperation project with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Speaking on the second round of negotiations with Russia on the enriched uranium project on February 16, Iran said that the negotiation will be held as scheduled, but emphasized that some adjustments will be made in the negotiation content due to the changes in the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Russia had shown its support for Iran's peaceful utilization of nuclear power, and stated that it would insist on not handing over Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, we saw that they have already agreed to hand over Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now that we have such a new development, we may therefore amend the previous agreement we reached with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the UN Security Council makes its final decision on whether to impose economic and political sanctions on Iran in March, Iran suggests holding continuous talks with relevant international organizations. It is also willing to cooperate with the international community in order to alleviate the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We stress that Iran will not give up the rights to peaceful use of nuclear power in order to strive for our economic development and the building of our country. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated relevant international law. We hope that the United States can understand. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Iran's nuclear issue is completely different from the Afghani and Iraqi issues. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the United States is also clear on this. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at some news on Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade the Japanese Defense Agency to a ministry to increase Japan's military power. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, intense debates have been created during the course, and it is full of twists and turns. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, scandals surfaced during the bidding, during the bidding on construction projects at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan's Defense Agency, leading to the arrest of existing and former officials. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, many people advised Koizumi to be careful in the course of upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, Koizumi stated recently that he will temporarily shelve the plan and will not submit it to the Cabinet for deliberation for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, he hopes that the two ruling parties will carefully discuss this issue and er, continue the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Another bit of news is that if you go to Japan, there is a new regulation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Japan plans to require the majority of the tourists, visitors visiting Japan, to have their fingerprints and pictures taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is to prevent dangerous figures from entering Japan and to avoid illegal immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, therefore, it should be more inconvenient to go to Japan now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, of course, there is good news in Japan recently. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Kiko, the wife of Japan's second prince, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The pregnancy has led to the hope of many Japanese that she will give birth to a son to inherit the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, she has also stirred up some waves in the imperial family, which has been relatively quiet. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Er, in fact, Kiko is definitely an older pregnant woman. Moreover, people had always believed that she was happy with a four-person household. </seg>
<seg id="17"> For her to get pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help but to speculate that, er, a fight for the throne between the two brothers may be unfolding in the imperial family. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, many people take delight in talking about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They claim that this incident may be traced back to a few years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, this is how it goes. It was in 2002 when the wife of the eldest Prince Naruhito was diagnosed with depression. As a result, the imperial family did not invest too much hope in them, and pressured the second eldest Prince Akishino in turn. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Akishino did not have too much of a response at the time. </seg>
<seg id="22"> However, in 2004, the conflict was intensified because Naruhito, er, was eager to protect his wife and um, criticized the imperial family in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, allegedly, the imperial family was furious at that time and requested the second-eldest Prince Akishino, who is of the same generation as Naruhito, to come forward to refute his brother, saying that his doting on his wife was a disrespect to the imperial family. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Since then, the brothers have been at odds. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Now, if the second-eldest Prince Akishino has a boy, well, then their spindle will become a pillar of the imperial family, </seg>
<seg id="26"> while the crown prince, who is also the eldest prince, will thus decline for sure. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Er, therefore, many people say that it will have a great impact on the imperial family and Japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In regard to Iran's announcement of postponing its nuclear negotiations with Russia, Annan urged Iran to stop its nuclear activities as soon as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not resistance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Moreover, there is news that the US Department of Defense has begun to work closely on the plan to bomb Iran as a last resort if diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Initially, the outside believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council imposing sanctions on Iran, but the two did not make public the discussions in this area after the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Both Bush and Annan reiterated that they hoped to resolve Iran's nuclear issue through talks. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed his worries over Iran's launching of enriched uranium activities and its decision to postpone the nuclear talks with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the US media reported that military strategists at the Pentagon have begun to work closely on the plan to take military actions against Iran in case diplomatic efforts fail and the United States uses military means to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the report, commanders at the US Central Command have started ascertaining the targets of attack. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The attack may be by means of the launch of ballistic missiles from submarines and air raids from B2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Annan appealed Monday for all parties to refrain from taking actions that will escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Military specialists analyzed that Iran may be capable of producing nuclear weapons in two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Bush has more than two years remaining in his second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will strive to resolve Iran's nuclear issue during his term of office, whether it is through peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Mou Naiqian, Phoenix TV, Washington. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Iranian President Ahmadinejad stated on the 13th that superpowers that use their own weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys from other countries in Tehran at the commemoration of the 27th Anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He indicated that the arms race and the fight for supremacy among nations will not produce any result. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The superpowers' appetite will never be satisfied. They even use weapons to threaten other nations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, he claimed that superpowers that rely on weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind can enjoy eternal peace and stability will soon arrive. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, we can see that it is not only a fight of words; in fact, the increasingly explosive situation between Iran and the Western world, with the United States, is becoming more intense. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Due to the mutually unyielding positions between Iran and the United States, some recent changes have appeared in which Iran officially announced the resumption of its enriched uranium refining program two days ago. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some Western diplomats have speculated that Iran might have actually resumed some enriched uranium refining procedures before that. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Iran announced that it will postpone the talks with Russia indefinitely, the negotiations on Russia refining enriched uranium for Iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, of course, the indefinite postponement of the negotiation plan is decided under the new development of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Recently, due to the continuous threat of the United States to attack Iran, a British think-tank - the Oxford Research Institute - has issued such a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the United States resorts to force, half the people will die. Moreover, it will definitely touch off um, continue the wave of violence in the Middle East this year. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In addition, some terrorist attacks will be intensified. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, oil prices will skyrocket; which is also among the series of domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The report also stated that if the United States fails to force Iran into compliance, it will definitely accelerate Iran's determination to produce nuclear weapons by itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> We just mentioned the Russia-Iran negotiation issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Iranian official spokesman indeed stated on Monday that due to the emergence of the new situation, it will postpone the negotiations with Russian officials on the refining of enriched uranium in Russia originally scheduled for the 16th. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had not received any formal notification from the Iranian authorities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It is still too early to tell if the meeting will continue. </seg>

Moreover, it was obvious that he lacks knowledge of history and has poor diplomatic sense. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The New York Times was the third-largest circulated newspaper in the United States last year, so it should be very influential in US society. </seg>

<seg id="31"> Earlier, Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili fiercely criticized Russia's position, refuting Russian President Putin's statement that if the West recognizes Kosovo, then Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia, arguing that Russia is sending encouraging signals to all the separatist regions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also declared earlier that it will protect the Russian citizens in South Ossetia, which implied the threat of direct force toward Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Roughead, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific fleet, announced Tuesday that the United States will dispatch four aircraft carriers to conduct the largest military exercise in 10 years in the Asian-Pacific region this summer. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead added that the United States will not er, consider China as a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. army hopes to conduct another joint military exercise with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The declaration immediately raised concern among U.S. defense experts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Heritage Foundation held a seminar Wednesday on the Pentagon's defense evaluation report. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The subtle relations between the defense report and the military exercise had become one of the discussion topics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some people argued that Roughead's open invitation for China to participate in the military exercise is a friendly gesture by the United States toward China. </seg>
<seg id="8"> While extending its invitation to China for its participation in a military exercise, the U.S. army also indicated its hope for more transparent operations by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Thus, some defense experts argued that it is a sign that the Pentagon cannot fathom China's intentions in expanding its military power, and hopes to learn about the real situation and feel each other out through a joint military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Moreover, since the defense evaluation report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of the month had considered China as the biggest potential threat in the future, thus, two defense experts also pointed out that the Asian-Pacific military exercise will be the first step for the U.S. Department of Defense to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xie Xiaoshuang, Phoenix TV, Washington. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, the wide attention given to this um, summertime military exercise by the United States is also because this will be the first time in 10 years that the United States has four um, aircraft carriers participating in a military exercise together. It is also the first time since the Vietnam War that the United States has dispatched the aircraft carrier on the East Coast to take part in such a military exercise in the um, Western Pacific region. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, the military exercises will indeed be very frequent. There will be four exercises within a few months. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, one of them will also be a multi-nation military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, the multi-nation military exercise will include Japan, Korea, and Australia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at a few Japanese news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> There is a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese politics recently. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Tsuneo Watanabe, President of The Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading outlet in Japan's media, instructed The Yomiuri Shimbun to publish um, articles criticizing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. Since then, The Yomiuri Shimbun has held the same position on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Er, well, um, Tsuneo Watanabe railed against Koizumi in um, his speech a few days ago, calling him very ignorant, and that he does not know any history or culture. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He also equated the visitation of the Yasukuni Shrine to the glorification of Hitler. He added that such an act by Koizumi has made China and Korea consider Japan as an extremely dangerous nation, which will cause endless trouble. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Why would Tsuneo Watanabe's position create huge shock waves? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, he is very influential in politics and has always been a hidden hand. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He had been a far rightist in the past. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He had supported the hawks and aggressively promoted the revision of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> However, it is a um, huge turn now. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He has turned the cannon around to start bombing Koizumi and opposing such a position. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, in 2004 when people criticized Koizumi for visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, um, Tsuneo Watanabe still claimed that, he claimed that he supported Koizumi, and asked him to stand up to the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Nonetheless, he made a speech recently saying, "I'll be 80 years old this year. I have very little time left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, now he comes forward and makes anti-war speeches in a lofty tone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> His change in um, allegiance no doubt creates a huge impact on Japanese, um society. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As Tsuneo Watanabe put it himself, "I believe I have the confidence and the ability to change the political situation." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He added that if the government exerts pressure on the freedom of speech and assembly and the editorial freedom of The Yomiuri Shimbun, he would risk his life to resist. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Then, what kind of situation has been formed now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Japan's largest newspaper, The Yomiuri Shimbun, and its second largest newspaper, um, the %pw Asahi Shimbun, the two major newspapers have joined hands in opposing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, the two major newspapers were two opposing groups. However, after the two presidents met, at least they had reached a consensus on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, they both adopt strong offensives in um, railing against Koizumi. It can be said that they have formed a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In fact, these two major newspapers have huge, um, influence on the mainstream public opinion in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, let us look at the meeting of the um, House of Representatives in Japan. In a recent meeting, the same remark was made by the top two successor candidates um, of um, Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who were these two people? </seg>
<seg id="25"> %pw one was Shinzo Abe, Chief Cabinet Secretary, and the other was Taro Aso, Japan's Foreign Minister, who has repeatedly made um, shocking remarks in recent days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What remark did both of them make? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They both said that Japan's war criminals of the Second World War were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they meant was that er, it was the international court that called them um, criminals and convicted them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> While in Japan, according to international laws, according to Japanese laws, er, the war criminals had not broken any Japanese laws. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Thus, they argued that war criminals of the Second World War should not be considered as criminals in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the meantime, um, Shinzo Abe mentioned that Japan should now have the whole world in view and develop its relationship with the United States and business and trading ties with um, East Asian countries. Moreover, it should develop close ties with India instead of focusing on China all the time. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Championship Hopeful but Not a Sure Thing </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Loving Life and Luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The gunpowder smoke of the Chinese Super Cup Soccer Game will soon bring flames of war. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Luneng Team of Taishan is ready for the new game season, and is preparing to rush to the championship again. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The battles for seizing dominance among Lian, Lu, and Hu, the three strong teams, will break out at any moment. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Who will win the championship at last? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on an analysis of actual strengths, although the Taishan Team has a great hope of seizing the championship, it has no full certainty of success. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the time for new team members to adapt to each other is short. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Taishan Team had nothing new last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Taishan Team introduced Li Leilei and Wang Liang, the two members from the national team, this year. Soon after that, it will also add two members to the team from foreign teams, and its actual strength should be seen as increased, not reduced. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But because the national team is preparing for the matches with the Palestinian and Iraqi teams, those members of the national team cannot coordinate with the members of this team. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When they return to the football club, the league matches will start right away, </seg>
<seg id="13"> So, the issue of adapting to each other is the biggest issue the Taishan Team is facing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I think that those members from the national team can be substitute players for the first several rounds of games in the league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Firstly, they can be trained to adapt to the team in matches; </seg>
<seg id="16"> secondly, those national team members who have played two group matches can have a rest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After several rounds of matches, their edge would be honed, and it won't be too late for them to participate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Second, its defense has hidden problems. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The defense of the Taishan Team was scolded as a sick one by its fans last year. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Li Leilei was introduced this year, and has improved the defense, but the team has not reached the time for sitting back and relaxing. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The problem of center halfbacks' and fullbacks' slowness in turning back still exists, and those substitute players are either older in age or lack experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If center halfbacks and fullbacks can solidly play their roles, the Taishan Team would have one more advantage in its path to seizing the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think that it does not hurt to use Ren Yongshun who has good physical qualities, although lacking experience. He can exercise this year in preparation for the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And also, it is OK to withdraw Gao Rao to play fullback. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Many members of the Taishan Team can play fullback, including Cui Peng and Hai Bin. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Rao is strong physically, and can aggressively and fiercely intercept the ball, and should be able to do a good job in the position of either center halfback or fullback. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Third, whether foreign players can adapt to the team. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The introduction of foreign players is a big issue that has been puzzling the Taishan Team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Nobody dares to say anything good about Dan Qiu's performance last year. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is known that foreign players have not been selected for introduction for this year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that in addition to introduction of an outstanding forward, a very good left-foot forward should be introduced too. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except Xing Rui, who played on the Taishan Team several years ago, there has not been a real left-foot player on the team. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although some players like Cui Peng can play the role, a real left-foot forward would be much better than one who is a guest player. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three issues can be solved well, the path for the Taishan Team to seize the championship should be somewhat smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Shandong football fan, I really hope that the Taishan Team will be able to seize the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> But frankly speaking, the Taishan Team is very hopeful, but has no full guarantee of winning the championship this year. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> BrandVista Post: </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> How is everyone? </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Spring Festival has passed us again like this, and friends who combined vacations with the Spring Festival holidays have gradually returned to their posts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We wish all friends a happy new year, if it is not too late to say Happy New Year now. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On that day I chatted with NPLCN in a cafe; he mentioned that the present Geometry Brand </seg>
<seg id="7"> Website looks much prettier. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Good from contents to formats. </seg>
<seg id="9"> His most favorite is the recent thoroughly innovated BBS that is based on Discuz Community. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As for the community, I have to thank someone. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He is Mr. Li Mingshun, the General Manager of Discuz Beijing Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="12"> A heap of results can be found if you search his name on Google. </seg>
<seg id="13"> You probably know that he was at Sina.com, and later he himself created a business, and established an Internet advertisement exchange platform for small and medium-size enterprises, similar to adbrite.com abroad. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He debated on MSN at that time. His rough idea is that: Geometry feels that the development of many of China's industries depends on the strength of private economy and small and medium-size enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But in China's present market, this situation cannot make people optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So, intellectual trades, similar services, and consultation of small and medium-size enterprises cannot form sizable ones. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Collection of higher fees for their own development will eventually bring a pessimistic cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He later went to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is an excellent community program based on PHP and MySQL databases. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer from Beijing, Geometry Brand's community is finally seeing the light again, and is stepping on stage with a very fresh face. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The feedback is very good. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The interface is clean and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Speed is quite quick. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I'm starting to feel a kind of joy at writing words that make myself aware of something and inspire others, and communicate with friends who pursue the same thing in the same trade about small things in our work and life in a very clean interface. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thanks Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> There is a lot of news in the advertisement field. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The system on opening advertisement trade regulated by the WTO is starting to be implemented from the beginning of January. </seg>
<seg id="28"> All of the big Laowai (old foreigners) have arrived on the site, one after another, and small Laowai are sharpening their knives noisily. It seems to be prosperous everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Baidi Advertising out of Singapore has many troubles. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Sir Martin is finally finding a little time away from the lawsuit in Italy to consider shuffling the deck after losing some heavyweight customers and continuous development setbacks on the Mainland. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Baidi Advertising and Batey will be incorporated into JWT network and maintain their brands, and will be managed by JWT. </seg>
<seg id="32"> And at the same time, some rumors say that Bates and 141 networks will be incorporated into the Aomei system, and will be managed by Aomei Advertising Network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although 141 has been returned to Aomei before, it is still an interesting thing to let Da Pisi return to Aomei. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Websites have updated many articles during the Spring Festival. We don't need to mention every one of them here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If everybody has time, he or she can check Websites. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, friends who have not participated in the new forum can click the mouse one more time without any trouble, and enter into the totally new Geometry Brand community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Feel the environment, experience the atmosphere, and contribute your words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Hope you'll be happy for finding the organization. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We wish every friend a beautiful mood. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Read this article, and wanted to share it with people. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is not an impulsion, but warmness and kindness staying in my heart for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I ask myself if it were me, what I would do. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The answer is very clear. I would hang up the phone, "You dialed a wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> This year I have been thinking about what really counts for helping people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have given up tentative conduct, such as donations of cash or items. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some friend said a couple of days ago that he has no time to take care of himself, not mention to help people, even though his desire for providing help is bigger than his ability. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wish you a happy day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mom of Ten Years Ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> It was one day ten years ago when this teacher was taking a nap by using the rest time at noon. Suddenly, the phone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She picked up the phone, and heard a strange and rude voice: "Your child stole a book, and we caught her. Come and hurry up!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> The crying noise of a little girl and denouncing voices from others came out of the handset. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She understood the thing immediately when she turned her head and looked at her only daughter, who was watching TV. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There must be a little girl who was caught by the saleswoman for stealing a book. She does not want her family members to know this, so she made up a phone number, and a phone call happens to come here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> She could of course hang up the phone and give no response, and even scold the other side. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Because this thing has nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But she herself is a teacher; maybe that girl is one of her pupils. </seg>
<seg id="21"> She could probably imagine through the phone that that little girl, who made a wrong decision at that moment, must be very panicked, and may be facing the most terrible situation of her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After she hesitated for a moment, she suddenly had an idea in her mind. Yes, I will do it this way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Then, she asked for the detailed address of the bookstore, and hurried there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As she expected, a little girl with tear stains all over her face was standing in the bookstore. </seg>
<seg id="25"> And those adults standing around were scolding her ferociously in loud voices. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She rushed to the poor little girl and held her in her arms, and turned her head to the sales clerks around, and said: "Talk to me if you have something to say. Do not terrify the child." </seg>
<seg id="27"> She took the little girl with her and walked out of the bookstore after she paid out several dozen Yuan as a fine, while the sales clerks were whispering reluctantly. Then, she could clearly see the face messed with tears and panic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She smiled, and brought the little girl home. She cleaned her up thoroughly and let her go without asking anything. </seg>
<seg id="29"> She especially urged her before she left, "If you want to read books, you could come here, auntie's home has a lot of books." </seg>
<seg id="30"> The little girl, who was still in a panic, gazed at her deeply before running away, and never showed up again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time passes as quickly as running water, and a period of ten years has passed in a flash without notice. </seg>
<seg id="32"> She had forgotten the thing a long time ago, and still lives there with a calm and serene life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One afternoon, knocking noises came from outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> A young and strange girl with a pretty face appeared when she opened the door. She had a big smile on her face and was holding a big pile of gifts in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> She asked with doubt. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The girl was moved and talked with a lot of words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It was not easy for her to find out from the strange girl's talking that she was the little girl of that year. Ten years after, she had graduated from a university without any difficulties, and now she had made a special trip to see her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The young girl said with a soft voice and tears in her eyes: "Although I still don't understand why you were willing to pretend to be my mom and save me, during these 10 years, I have always felt that I want to call you mom." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes also started to become blurred. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "If I did not help you that day, what was going to happen to you?" She asked with curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The face of the girl suddenly became gloomy. She shook her head slightly and said, "I cannot explain it clearly, I might have done a stupid thing or even killed myself." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The teacher felt a sudden jump in her heart, and began to rejoice in her mind. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The decision she made at that moment in that year could even impact a person in her life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smile on the face of that girl, she also smiled with her. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Military Situation Observation: How Long can Iran Hold Up under Air Attacks by US Armed Forces? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If traditional warfare of attrition is described as letting an opponent bleed to death, then modern warfare is shooting at the head of an opponent first and making him a "human vegetable" before he bleeds. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The gap between the military capabilities of Iran and the United States is not their quantities, but understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which came to a draw with Iraq in an eight-year war, does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The British International Intelligence Comments pointed out a few days ago, after it analyzed the state of US armed forces movements, that the US armed forces are preparing to launch large-scale air attacks on Iran... </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current status of the Iranian air force is worrisome. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The present status of the Iranian air forces is quite similar with that of the Iraqi air force before the Iraq War in 2003. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Iran itself does not have the capacity to independently develop modern weapons, and is embargoed from importing weapons from the West. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Once a war breaks out, it is really a question of whether those old and obsolete aircrafts of the Iranian air force could take off to confront the US armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Currently, the Iranian air defense system is mainly composed of the air force and ground air defense troops of the Iranian regular armed forces, and the air-defense forces of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Among them, the Iranian air forces have around 50,000 troops, and more than 300 various types of combat aircrafts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Their primary aircraft models include the F-4 "Phantom," F-5 "Tiger," and F-14 "Tomcat" made by the US and the MIG-29 made by Russia, etc. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The ground air defense troops are mainly equipped with surface to air missiles, including the US "Hawk," British "Javelin" and some of the Russian "SAM" series of missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Harold Hutchinson, a US military expert, and Helamuchisin, a military expert from Russia's Politics and Military Analysis Institute, analyzed the current status of the Iranian air defense forces, and think that the Iranian air defense capacities and air defense system and construction still have some loopholes in the current status. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchinson thinks that the Iranian air forces are not at all at the same level with the US armed forces from the perspective of whole actual strength. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A lot of the Iranian combat aircrafts made by the US cannot be used because of lack of parts, upgrades, and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The F-14 fighter planes previously regarded as the elite ones in the Iranian air force only have about ten capable of taking off from the ground. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The combat reliability of AIM 54 "Phoenix" missiles, claimed to be capable of over-the-horizon attacks, is also doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Helamuchisin pointed out that those Iranian air defense missile systems provided by the US from the 1970s to the 1980s of the last century have lost their combat powers because of lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And other air defense weapons that do not form any systems, such as weapons obtained from Russia and other countries, have no capabilities at all to cope with the US armed forces, which have powerful electromagnetic combat capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Scrappy weapons affect combat power </seg>
<seg id="23"> Apparently, the Iranian government realizes that its fate in a war depends on whether it is capable of defending the sky over its head, and is starting to prepare only at the last moment, scrape weapons together, and strengthen its air defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Its methods can be summed up as the two strategies from the current state: </seg>
<seg id="25"> The first one is to conceal important nuclear facilities as much as possible and strengthen their anti-strike capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to a report from the British newspaper Times, Iran has hidden core parts of its nuclear facilities 18 meters under ground and added a protection shell of 2-meter-thick cement, including the nuclear plant in Natanz and the uranium enrichment center in Isfahan. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But the US armed forces have taken a strategy in advance. They saw the effects of underground bunkers in anti-air attack combat as early as during the Gulf War in 1991, and have rushed developing various ground-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Through more than 10 years' studies on targets, the US armed forces have had a whole set of combat methods and weapons coping with underground consolidated bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Iran has also purchased a lot of advanced air defense weapons from Russia in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the end of last year, the Iranian government has reached agreements with Russia, one after another, for the purchase of the Pechora-2A air defense missile system and 29 sets of "Dower" air defense missile systems, worth 700 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, a modern war is a rivalry between systems. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Various US armed forces air-attack weapons are developed by the US itself, and they have been sharpened and become a set of war machines with outstanding effects after years of tests in actual warfare. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And those "new weapons" scraped together by Iran from other countries are still a question of whether they can form combat power in a short time. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Weapons are not Iran's only gap. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Combat Outlines, published by the US armed forces in 1982, first came up with the idea of "integrated air-ground warfare," and stressed the use of air supremacy to strike high-value targets in an enemy's strategic depth area, paralyzing the enemy's command system at the beginning of a war, and making him as "meat on the cutting board" even though he has very powerful conventional forces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the Gulf War in 1991, Kosovo War in 1999, and the Iraq War in 2003, what the US armed forces paid attention to was not how many aircrafts the opponents had, but the firing range of their own "Tomahawk" cruise missile. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Although the Iranian government has prepared for possible air attacks and started to take measures to strengthen air defense capabilities, Iran, which came to a draw with Iraq in an eight-year war, does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the development of US armed forces military transition work in recent years, the air-attack activities of the US armed forces are totally different from the carpet bombing method in the Vietnam War era, and rely on various new high-tech weapons and high-precision and whole-depth air strikes that are based on modern information technology. </seg>
<seg id="39"> How long the Iranian ground air defense system can sustain itself in this kind of air strikes is still an unknown element. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rivaling Microsoft by Uniting with Google; Is Dell Collecting a "Stocking Fee?" </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Dell Inc. (US; DELL) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is testing personal computers loaded with Google's software packages. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This move might pose a serious threat to the dominant status of Microsoft Corp., MSFT, in the PC software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Jess Blackburn, the news spokesman for Dell Corporation, said that the corporation is assessing Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After the software is installed, PC users can use the software to search not only on the Internet, but also for information stored on their PCs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn confirmed that the software the corporation is testing includes the Dell homepage supported by Google, Google's desktop search system and Google's toolbar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Google's news spokesman, Jon Murchinson, also confirmed at the same time that his company is testing a batch of software, developed by Google, with Dell. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As the Wall Street Journal previously reported, Google - the IT new baron - is negotiating with Dell and Hewlett-Packard Co., and is trying to persuade these computer manufacturing giants to install Google's software for their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to an internal source cited by the Wall Street Journal, to achieve the goal, Google might pay 1 billion dollars to Dell in the coming three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, neither company has disclosed related details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And also, the Hewlett-Packard side has refused to make a comment on it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Microsoft Corporation news spokesman, Neil Charney, refused to make a comment on the news mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Microsoft is currently planning to promote its next-generation search tool for the Windows operating system and strengthen development of its online business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the day the news was released, Google's stock price fell another 4.46%, dropping to 367.92 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft's stock price fell 1%, and closed at 26.94 dollars on that day. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts pointed out that Google is anxious to seek another direction of expansion in addition to network searches, and that its integration with Dell and other PC giants might prompt Google to threaten Microsoft's core business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Matt Rosoff, an analyst on Microsoft's direction at a market investigation and research company, said that Microsoft is absolutely concerned and worried that Google is eager to expand its new income sources. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But some analysts do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Charles Di Bona, an analyst at market analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein, pointed out that it is too early for Google to shake Microsoft's dominant status. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reporter's Journal: Google Shakes Microsoft's Domination? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hui Zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> There is no doubt that computers have become necessities in the life and work of modern people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, there is only a minority of people who understand the working rationale of computers, when everyone can skillfully operate them. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Like they use "dummy" cameras, most "newbies" can play the black boxes well as long as those boxes have friendly interfaces, and convenient and simple software. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Thus, original software installed on a PC manufacturer's products can usually determine most consumers' using habits. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is through this measure that Microsoft has tightly controlled the PC operating system market. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Right now, Google, a new rival of Microsoft, tends to share part of the market through the same measure. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A well-known economics medium in Taiwan recently made a very interesting metaphor. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Computer manufacturers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard are starting to use computers like shelves in a supermarket and are collecting the "stocking fee" from software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> A successful bidder can make its own software show up in the 'critical ten minutes' when users turn on their new computers, and guide consumers to use its products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This kind of fee collection mode is like how a supermarket collects stocking fees from food manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="33"> This phenomenon demonstrates that Microsoft's control power is beginning to loosen without a doubt. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Managers at Microsoft have warned Bill Gates that the Microsoft's hegemonic status will eventually be threatened if Google starts to pay PC manufacturers for installation of Google's software on their computer products. </seg>
<seg id="35"> No matter what the outcome is, the number one status that Microsoft has been enjoying in those comfortable days may become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, it is easy to become dominant, but it is difficult to maintain a dominant status. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Just Sword: Prospects for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: Just Sword </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember that in the beginning of 2005, Apple Journal in Hong Kong published an article titled "Dharma Wheel Spins Constantly and Its Merits Can Overcome an Enemy Country." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article alleged that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced rapidly while singing triumphant songs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article stated that overseas officials of the Chinese Communist Party acted like buffoons suppressing Falun Gong in various places, and totally lost face when beginning Falun Gong learners told the truths everywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But compared with the marvelous scene showing the great wave of Party membership withdrawal brought by the "Nine Comments" in 2005, 2004 does not seem outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Then, how will 2006 be? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The two events that occurred at the beginning of this year can probably demonstrate some development track for this year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One is the article "Elimination of Evil" published by the founder of Falun Gong. This article announced and sentenced that those agents of the Chinese Communist Party will face their coming judgment day after July 20, 1999. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Maybe many people still have doubts about or disbelieve this article. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But no matter whether they believe it or not, the history and facts will prove it! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, those agents of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are like rats living in dark ditches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their "natural or accidental death" will not draw attention from the society and public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But broad deaths or remorse of CCP agents at home and abroad brought by the Heavens will definitely bring powerful strikes and shake the power strata of the CCP. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They will have to carefully consider their path of retreat and road for life - withdrawal from the Party, desertion or changing their side under the awesome deterrence of the elimination brought by the Heavens. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus, the "superbly stable bureaucratic system and group of the CCP" will begin to be shaken, disrupted, and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> The other event is the hunger strike campaign for human rights launched by Gao Zhicheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This suddenly arisen campaign, which did not receive a good prediction from some people in the beginning, unexpectedly brought warm reactions from everywhere in the world, and common responses from all strata and various forces. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this activity can integrate various just forces and suffering masses into a connection and make it real and big, then the outside force that launches the final strike on the CCP, the evil regime that is as fragile as a pile of eggs, will finally be formed from it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If we say that 2005 was a year when the Communist Party was eliminated from the perspective of the spiritual aspect, then 2006 will be the phase in which the Party will be gotten rid of in both the spiritual and material aspects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With the further spread of the "Nine Comments" and further development of the wave of Party membership withdrawal, the self-disruption of the CCP, and the cohesion and formation of outside just forces, the life of the CCP monster will formally enter into a countdown state. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The wills of the Heavens and humans have been integrated, and the sacred power and human strength are gathering. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The long sword in the sky is directly pointed at the CCP monster! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If we say that 2004 was a year for advancing rapidly while singing triumphant songs, and 2005 is a marvelous year, then what will be the conclusion of 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it will be a shocking great change, and a victory and triumphant return! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Title: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, the Secretary of Linyi City Party Committee: Hooliganism will Also Harm Yourself </seg>
<seg id="6"> Website for sending mail: Feeling Like Old Friends at the First Meeting (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006). This website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> Until yesterday, the government of Linyi, led by you, had illegally placed Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You collaborated with rogues and the mafia society to put a blind legal citizen in jail illegally for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You cut off his home's phone line, installed a cell phone jamming device in his yard; </seg>
<seg id="10"> You also beat him and his family members many times. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Your barbarous conduct has gone beyond the bottom line of a civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You also used means of rogues and the mafia society to beat me and lawyer Li Fangping in the beginning of October, 2005. But we bore this, and we always tried to understand your difficult situation as much as possible, and were even acquiescent for a time of the house arrest of Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, 165 days have passed. You not only have not controlled your behavior, but you also make it worse. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You sent a big team of policemen and rogues to harass villagers; </seg>
<seg id="15"> You continued to arrest and beat villagers; </seg>
<seg id="16"> What you have done is too outrageous! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, I clearly remind you that those means of rogues and the mafia society will harm yourself in turn at the moment when you continue to organize rogues and the mafia society to besiege Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was worth your examination when this thing started in the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The family planning of Linyi is the first one from the bottom of the provincial list in the whole province. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The anxiety in your mind is understandable as the secretary of the city Party committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But it is wrong for you to think that only use of violence and force can implement the state's law and policy because of the low qualities of the people in Linyi. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Whose fault exactly is it that citizens do not coordinate with the conduct of the government? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it because of the low qualities of the citizens or much less public trust, since the government has told too many lies and made too many schemes? </seg>
<seg id="24"> If (we) say that the same government's conduct was not that absurd ten years ago, in 2005 China's society has made obvious progress and human rights protection has been written into the Constitution; don't you think that your barbarous conduct is too outrageous? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why don't you examine that only your Linyi dares to act in this way? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Why is only your Linyi unable to practice law enforcement by using democratic and legal means? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Linyi City should have been able to make a sincere explanation and make the public understand, after a batch of brave citizens including Chen Guangcheng reported about the fact of the barbarous law enforcement, a batch of citizens including Teng Biao - who dared to protect citizen's rights - were involved, and the investigation conclusion was made by the National Family Planning Committee. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After all, family planning is a difficult topic with Chinese characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Everyone can understand your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However, you took a further absurd measure - brought Chen Guangcheng back and put him in jail by catching him from Beijing - and also tried to accuse him of illegally providing the state's confidential information. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you think that it is a very absurd accusation for a blind man who lives in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> In fact, as long as you have truly corrected mistakes, as long as you have done things very well, are you still afraid of the criticism of a blind man? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Is it necessary for you to send several dozens of people to watch him 24 hours a day, and even sentence him in a hurried and desperate way? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I and Lawyer Li Fangping arrived in Dongshigu Village on October 4, 2005. We demonstrated our very clear position and hoped to solve the conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We made a suggestion that we could talk with your officials to learn your ideas and requests. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We took the initiative and suggested that we could help you to persuade Chen Guangcheng, to influence him not to say some of his words. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We hoped that you would not treat a blind man in this way, and both sides should make some compromises. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, your decision maker just follow his own way, and moreover, even had "carefully planned" an episode - to beat and put us in jail illegally. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think that your activities can make us scared? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We have not done anything that violates laws. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We are fearless. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Although China's legal system is not perfect, at least it has not become absolutely lawless. </seg>
<seg id="43"> You think that use of means of rogues and the mafia society can scare us away, then you have greatly underestimated our determination and willpower. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As long as we would like to, we have many people who have many legitimate reasons to go to Linyi or go to see Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat lawyers and scholars one, two, and three times, but every time would attract broad attention and reports about it. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you really dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Don't you care about your official position very much? </seg>
<seg id="48"> If somebody is beaten and injured, will your position still be in a solid status? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Not listening to our reasonable advice, instead using some indecent means of rogues, don't you think this is very silly and dangerous? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to tell you clearly that, in China, there is a big batch of excellent citizens who are loyal to conscience and follow the legal system. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We do not fear rogues and the mafia society. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We cannot stand reckless trampling on the bottom line of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you have done too much beyond boundaries, we will calmly and confidently march forward batch by batch toward your sticks until the moment when you retreat. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You should be clear that use of the means of rogues and the mafia society is not something good for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Do not think that you can get rid of any link connected with those local rogues or hooligans who beat villagers as long as you hide backstage. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Finally, I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> A person who was blind from his childhood, graduated from a college of traditional Chinese medicine, self-studied laws and English, and sued Beijing Subway Company for the interest of the blind, and brought tap water for villagers, and became a well-known "Lawyer Chen" everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="58"> You even mobilized shameful indecent individuals to make rumors about and slander him, and tried to accuse him of illegally sending confidential information across the border. Don't you think that what you did is too outrageous? </seg>
<seg id="59"> It is illegal for you to place Chen Guangcheng under house arrest, and it is also dangerous for you to do this. </seg>
<seg id="60"> You should have been able to release him for sure. </seg>
<seg id="61"> If the conduct of barbarous law enforcement has been stopped, how long could he maintain the criticism if you let him criticize it freely? </seg>
<seg id="62"> But today you are continuously smearing your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> You won't be peaceful as long as Chen Guangcheng has not been set for free for a day. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It is enough for you to make him suffer. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We would never stand by and do nothing if you still want to charge him with any crime or use further rogue means. </seg>

</poster>
<seg id="3"> I admit very disappointedly that the Chinese nation does not deserve to have democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Aren't those who post their messages here doing this thing now! </seg>
<seg id="5"> The pity is that there are not many people who go online and read it (compared with 1.4 billion). </seg>
<seg id="6"> Those who go online and care and participate in these kinds of topics would be much fewer: I dare to allege that the number would be less than 1% of people online. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Not to mention that this network has the Golden Shield project, which is the biggest, most thorough, advanced, expensive, and quality one. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is true. </seg>
<seg id="9"> One could feel depressed, hopeless, helpless, and even think of surrendering, but if one wants to live a human life, whom can he depend on except that he himself struggles for it? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although doing a thing depends on human effort, and success relies on the Heavens, I would think I am wrong if I have not made an effort for my own ideal, even though it is not successful, and I deserve to live like a dog. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Making an effort for a just thing itself can make one's own life somewhat wonderful, and at least in his heart when he evaluates himself. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, I do not need to be concerned about China's future at all, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the environment in the world is no longer allowing a regime that has not been elected to exist for long. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is just a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> What I lament is that the Chinese nation is very lucky to be led on the path to hell by a world-class great man and completely exploited from its bone and blood whenever it is at a historical turning point. Even if somebody calls piles of white bones and areas of blood stains along the path as brilliances, and forces us to be proud of the brilliances. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Everywhere has a dark night, but the longest one is in Shenzhou (the sacred state). </seg>
<seg id="17"> People would suffer a lot when the Qin Emperor integrated with the Confucian Sage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Qin Shihuang was an open tyranny and the Confucian Sage privately washed brains. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is not that Chinese people do not deserve to have democracy; it is because they have not had the democratic gene or their gene has been degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A nation that has been established for more than three thousand years, it might have had democracy a long time ago if its national culture contained democratic elements. </seg>
<seg id="21"> What were Chinese people doing when Athens established a democratic system, Rome set up a republic, the British passed the Constitution, the French published the Declaration of Human Rights, and the Americans issued the Declaration of Independence? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Mongolians had a Kurultai system for selection of their king before they entered into Zhong Yuan; Manchurians in their early time had a Ministers Council of the Prince Regent for democratic consultation. Why were those systems all gone when they entered into the Han region? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Chinese people pursue materials only and have no interest in spiritual faith and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If you do not believe it, as long as a Chinese person has an election right, he can sell it to you for a meat pancake. </seg>
<seg id="25"> 500,000 years later, if Chinese people want democracy, there must be an earthquake coming. If you can run, please do it! </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dalai Envoy Holding Closed-Door Meeting with Chinese Officials </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Dalai Lama stressed that he hopes that Tibet will have autonomy instead of independence. </seg>
<seg id="5"> An envoy of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader in exile, is holding a closed-door meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing, and no details have been disclosed publicly. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth formal meeting since China and the Dalai government in exile restored their contact in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But as usual, neither side has disclosed any details when holding the closed-door meeting. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A reporter said that both sides have held many talks, but have not made any substantial achievement so far. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in North India, said that he hopes that Tibet will have autonomy instead of independence. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Chinese side refused to make any comment on the bilateral talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But as analysts said, the reason why Beijing hoped to have the bilateral talks is partially because it is worried that if the spiritual leader in exile dies, it might make Tibetans unhappier about China's rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural identification </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Dalai government in exile delegation is led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was the chief delegate for several previous talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman for the Tibetan government in exile said that several talks held in Switzerland between them and Chinese officials in 2005 were very "close and frank," which brings hope to Tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesman said that they hope to eventually solve related issues with the Chinese leadership based on the foundation established by negotiations, and let the Tibetans have freedom, and maintain the cultural identification that they think is the most important thing. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Dalai Lama Envoy Reiterated not to Seek Tibetan Independence. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Dalai Lama will visit Washington DC this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Before the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, visits the United States on November 8, his envoy said that the Tibetan government in exile does not request Tibetan independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hopes that the Chinese government will ensure protection of the unique Tibetan culture and tradition. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is expected that when the Dalai Lama visits the United States next week, he will discuss Tibetan issues with President Bush, and hope that Bush could urge the Chinese government to give Tibet real autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Delegates of the Dalai and officials from Beijing had direct contact for the first time in Bern in July of this year. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "A Real Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari pointed out that both the Tibetan government in exile and Chinese authorities have seen some positive aspects from their talks in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Dalai Lama's envoy discovered that leaders from Beijing, especially those delegates of the Central United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, are more willing to listen to their views than they did before. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that there are too many differences between the Tibetan government in exile and the Chinese government, and there is a big gap between the positions of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that in the past five years, the Tibetan government in exile has done its best to create a good environment for negotiation requested by China, </seg>
<seg id="28"> and China should also create a good environment for negotiation of the Tibetan issue, and should not suppress the Dalai Lama all the time. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said that the Dalai Lama does not request Tibetan independence, and Tibet is still a part of China, but the Chinese government must maintain the unique culture of Tibet and "let Tibetans have a real autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari also pointed out that some Chinese think that as soon as the Dalai Lama passes away, the Tibetan issue will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said that this view is very dangerous, because once the Dalai Lama is gone, China would lose the historical opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the request raised by the Dalai Lama, and comes up with a final solution, the Dalai Lama would not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally any more. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Negotiation and Compromise are the Important Means of Democracy! (ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I just now saw a poster on "Great Decency -To Old Mr. Guiren" sent by a network friend. </seg>
<seg id="4"> His (her) original words are that "Negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy. Otherwise, a split because of different views is a failure of democracy!!! Hope that those ideal democrats pay fully attention to this!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> This plain and tasteless sentence, which has not attracted interest from any network friends, has made me imagine a lot and have many sorts of feelings. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At that moment I thought of the ancient times of China and the past of the West. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I seldom sent the main poster. I cannot help but reply to the poster of the network friend in the way of the main poster. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's see China's ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everyone knows that since Qin Shihuang established the universally unified and centralized power system in China, any subsequent dynasties were operated under the political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although the Han Dynasty temporarily implemented a "two-track system," i.e. a political system that practiced the feudal system and centralized power system at the same time, it eventually switched to a complete centralized power system in the end. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The outcome of this kind of centralized power system had an advanced aspect in the historical condition by then, which promoted the development of productivity. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But we should also see that the long-term operation of the system for more than 2,000 years had made local administrations lacking of their creativities, initiatives, and enthusiasms, and unable to make various suitable systems and policies for local developments based on local circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The pyramid type of ruling system had made lower-class officials looking upward only and following directions from their superiors for everything. </seg>
<seg id="14"> There was no room for coordination and negotiation because even local officials at the county level were appointed by the central government, not to mention those common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When rights of farmers were infringed upon in ancient China, they could only bear it time and again. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Only when their basest rights were threatened, i.e. when a famine spread in big areas, a tyrannical rule or natural disaster caused loss of their living rights, would they rebel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In more than 2,000 years, many peasant uprisings spread everywhere in the country like storms, but they never won a victory in a real sense except Zhu Yuanzhang, from Chen Sheng, and Wu Guang, who did not plan their uprising to the planned Huang Jin Insurrection, from the Huang Chao Revolt in the Tang Dynasty to the Li Zhicheng Rebellion that established a dynasty for only a month. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty created by Zhu Yuanzhang was only a cycle of other dynasties, and there were no systematic changes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Zhu Yuanzhang, who came from a common family and did not receive much education, played the Chinese ancient centralized power system to a sick extent, and to extremes. Since then, the vigorous state of the type of the Tang Dynasty that was open, free, and tolerant, had become depressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The atmosphere of freedom of speech disappeared in the vast land of China for a time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Human nature was suppressed to the maximum extent. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Everybody became very cautious and dared not to say more words with reverence and awe. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This was the only outcome of peasant uprisings in 2,000 years, and it made Chinese people neither humans nor ghosts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Let's see the Medieval Ages of the so-called dark time in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Medieval Ages of Western Europe were formed after the Western Rome was destroyed by nomadic nations, and lasted for a thousand years. They had nothing to do with the ancient Greece and Rome of the past. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Those ages featured the feudal system, i.e. land holding. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Many layers of land feudal lords, from the top to the bottom, had more autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="28"> No matter whether small feudal lords who had an area of several square kilometers, or nobles who had titles of Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, and Baron, since superiors and inferiors, and the left and right, could balance, restrain, and were interdependent with each other, and had their prerequisites and capabilities to strive for their own rights against kings, the scenes in which nobles sat with a king negotiating for their own interest emerged, which never happened in China's ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Compromises and concessions were made mutually instead use of violent means to knock down or replace opponents. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In this way, through making various contracts, rights were continuously transferred to nobles and common people, and they had more and more rights, and kings had fewer and fewer. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Later, the British Queen had only a status for display, and not any substantial power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Democracy was gradually realized in this way! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let's come back again to compare with ancient China, where every power was concentrated in the hands of emperors (except Li Shimin), and there were almost no nobles. It was very difficult for peasants to be able to sit in front of a negotiation table, joyfully making compromises and concessions on a contract agreed to by both sides while enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under this circumstance, when the living right was taken away, only violent means could overthrow an existing dynasty and try to replace it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Its outcome was the repeated cycle from the peak of the Tang Dynasty to the sick status of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparing histories between China and the West, we discovered that the contradictions between rulers and the ruled in ancient China were much more intensified than those in ancient Western countries. </seg>
<seg id="37"> No Western countries had so many continuous peasant uprisings as ancient China had. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In the Western countries, when differences between ancient royal families and peasants emerged, what nobles and common people thought of first was to settle them through a negotiation path, to obtain more rights gradually by making mutual concessions, and they seldom used violent means. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding this, when we enter into the 21st century, we can still see those democratic warriors in networks who have inherited the ideology of the absolute power concentration system of the Ming Dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and have been poisoned by the virus of the Cultural Revolution that they can say nothing except those words of "Down with or overthrow something." </seg>
<seg id="41"> And those concepts are the biggest barrier to democracy, because those people do not understand that negotiation, coordination, and compromise are the most important means and path for realization of democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cao Xiaoming: Who is Going to "Pay the Bill" for Enriching Cultural Activities in Rural Areas </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The author was lucky to spend this year's Spring Festival in a rural area of the Mainland, and visited some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> I was not only influenced by the dense atmosphere of the festival in the Chinese rural area, but also concerned about those boring cultural activities there. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The author discovered in a village where my relatives lived that this village organized villagers spontaneously to play a drama called "trotting horse lamp" for every Spring Festival in the past. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The drama is based on figures in the story of The Three Kingdoms. Any adult or child could play a role in the drama, and villagers were not bored at all to watch it a hundred times. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There were several of this kind of performance teams of "trotting horse lamp" in the whole township. They performed not only in their own villages, but also went to other villages for visits, and exchanged frequently. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But this village did not organize the performance this year. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The reason is that just the costumes for "trotting horse lamp" would cost a lot, which were bought in the past through donations from villagers. Now they are too worn out to be taken on. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Nobody was willing to donate any more, if asking villagers for donations household by household. Other villages in the township had a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The village suddenly became quiet without the "trotting horse lamp." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Adults started to play Mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Children also began to play cards. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Villagers said that this festival had no fun. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The big scene in the countryside is either shooting off fireworks or playing Mahjong during the festival. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The gambling trend cannot be stopped even though it is prohibited time and again, and is spread even further. Gambling for up to ten thousand Yuan has become a routine game. Especially, big batches of those migrant farmer workers who come back to their hometowns from other areas have played major roles in gambling sites. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Their hard-earned money from working in other areas for a year is lost in this way. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Family disputes occurred time and again because of gambling, which sometimes causes tragedies with families broken up and decimated. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some farmers said that they gambled not only during festivals but also participated in gambling frequently in slack seasons. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Nowhere to go if they did not gamble. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is too difficult to organize cultural activities and look for "fun" in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Not only are there no facilities and funding, but also nobody organizes them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But in this aspect, the practice in Jiangxi is definitely good news for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses, the government of Jiangxi Province not only implemented the policy that "the government provides funding for it; the market operates it; townships build stages; and farmers watch dramas" last September, </seg>
<seg id="25"> but they also arranged at least 60 million Yuan every year for the special fund for rural cultural causes and delivered good-quality cultural products to the rural masses. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the beginning of this New Year, it added an additional 40 million Yuan, a total of 100 million Yuan, for the establishment of special funding for the rural cultural cause. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And also, what this special funding "paid" toward the farmers' "bill" is quite a good deal: </seg>
<seg id="28"> Various professional performance organizations are invited to have shows in rural areas, and provide at least four shows for every town each year. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Movie companies at every level are invited to organize film projection teams to show movies in the countryside, and at least six feature or scientific education movies should be shown for every administrative village each year; </seg>
<seg id="30"> Cultural activities with local features participated in by the masses are organized and developed at least two to three times for every township each year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is not difficult for us to see from the "purchase list" that the government does not simply pay the bill, but thinks hard how to use the limited funds in the critical area and deliver a cultural banquet that exceeds its money value to the farmer masses, and has done a big substantial thing for them. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now, a lot of farmers are very happy and joyful for immunity from providing "royal grains and state's tax." </seg>
<seg id="33"> If every government can pay the "bill" for enriching cultural activities of the farmer masses as Jiangxi did, it would be another happy thing falling from the sky for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And this "happy thing" can not only liberate farmers from the Mahjong table, and make them "active" in cultural activities, but also add bricks and tiles for the construction of the new socialist countryside. </seg>

<seg id="1"> It Was a False Alarm that a Child of Wang Peirong Was Almost Hijacked </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> peirongwangsohu@gmail.com </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> It was a false alarm that a child of Wang Peirong was almost hijacked </seg>
<seg id="4"> The child of Wang Peirong recounted it completely at a little bit after 9 p.m. on the evening of January 24, 2006: </seg>
<seg id="5"> The child of Wang Peirong was called off by a gate guard when she was making up missed physics lessons at the Third Middle School of Xuzhou on the morning of January 24, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The guard said to Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men had told the gate guard at the Third Middle School that Wang Tianjiao, the child of Wang Peirong, had not gone back home for three days because of discord between her parents. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now her mother was missing, and they were leaders from her mother's work unit, and wanted to enter the Third Middle School and take away Wang Peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Peirong's child said: what the three men said was totally untrue. She refused to go with the three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Wang Peirong's child was not taken away with the help of the gate guard of the Third Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child called one of her mother's leaders at noontime to confirm it. The leader denied that he had sent his men to visit the Third Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Wang Peirong's child obtained a phone number of one of her father's leaders from her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Wang Peirong's child said: three men visited the Third Middle School and wanted to take me away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The leader asked: why didn't you go with them? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Wang Peirong's child said: I would be dead for sure if I went with them. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone right away after she finished her words. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Wang Peirong felt that the case was serious after she listened to her child's description, and reported it to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The feedback from a public security station on January 25 was that Wang Peirong's child's description was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The public security station asked the security unit of Kuangda if it had sent those men to look for Wang Peirong's child; the response was no. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The station asked the security unit again, and other units under Kuangda, if they had sent those men to look for Wang Peirong's child; their responses also were no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some related department passed on a message to Wang Peirong and her family members through another person, and asked them to pay attention to their security. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Leaders of some related department in Xuzhou City had paid close attention to the incident after it occurred. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The possibility of hijacking the child was excluded through an investigation done by the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked leaders of related departments in Xuzhou City and the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a false alarm that was probably mainly caused by the gate guard at the Third Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Now the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City finds out that, on January 24, three men, including leaders of the work unit of the Physics Institute where Wang Peirong works, called Wang Peirong, but could not find her (Wang Peirong still does not know what for so far). They tried to find Wang Peirong in a hurry and wanted to look for a teacher of Wang Peirong's child to ask if Wang Peirong's child was still in Xuzhou or not. </seg>

<seg id="28">  http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&amp;typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> What a corrupted official cares about is those several related officials who are his superiors in the current cadre and anti-corruption mechanisms, not the masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Thus, once he feels that he has successfully deceived or tamed those several officials who can determine his fate, he would boldly do whatever he likes to conduct his great cause for accumulation of wealth through corruption, and could ignore the feelings of the masses of people that are only a few feet away from them. </seg>
<seg id="31"> On the contrary, if common people who do not have power in their hands take the initiative to oppose corruption, they might bring extremely brutal strikes and retaliation upon themselves, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or be imposed with political accusations, and end up with failure before achieving any victory. </seg>

<seg id="1"> We now turn our attention once again to the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government had sent a letter to the IAEA requiring the removal before the middle of the month of all devices monitoring Iranian nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Due to the IAEA's decision to report the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has declared a halt to all supportive and cooperative measures taken in regards to the nuclear issue and said it would no longer authorize the IAEA to make surprise checks of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Addressing the current tension over the Iranian nuclear issue, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens, Greece that that Russian-Iranian cooperation was ongoing. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And that it would become the motive force for a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On the same day, a  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Russia's proposal to Iran about setting up a joint venture in Russia for enriching uranium was still valid. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two sides may discuss the issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The same day, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lugar said at UN headquarters in New York that the US does not approve of an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Recently, Israeli defense experts were reported as saying that, if necessary, the Israeli air force may heavily damage Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to Xinhua News Agency， Russian Vice Foreign Minister Kyslyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue and help Iran obtain lawful power for the peaceful development of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kyslyak said that Russia's proposal about launching a joint venture for enriching uranium with Iran is still open. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to consult with Iran regarding the issue soon. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In late December last year, Russia delivered a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint venture for enriching uranium in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Both the EU and the US agreed that the plan was an acceptable compromise. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But Iran wants Russia to continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that although the IAEA reported the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, the organization's responsibility for settling the issue has not been passed on to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, the parties concerned should still try to break the deadlock over the issue within the framework of IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Under an IAEA resolution, IAEA Director General El Baradei will deliver a report on the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating the report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We believe that such a resolution, it talks about requiring the Iranians...well ... being able to implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and honor their commitments. Besides, it does not deliver the issue or pass it on to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, China has been seeking a plan for the peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic channels. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, Director of the Department of Armament Control for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met in Tehran with Ali Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, for talks on the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is in the process of organizing a new Palestine autonomous government, officially announced that, with the exception of choice for prime minister, the list of cabinet members in the new government is essentially in order. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This triggered speculations among outsiders regarding the choice for the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the 8th, a senior Hamas official revealed to the Associated Press that Hamas intends to nominate Al-Khudairi , board chairman of Gaza's Islamic University (and a merchant), as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but the nomination has not yet been formally delivered to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With the support of Hamas, 50-year-old Al-Khudairi took part in the election of Palestinian Legislative Council held last month in the capacity of independent candidate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Khudairi has never mentioned violence or anti-Israeli content in his open speeches. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But he once indicated that Palestine was in need of internal reform. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A senior delegation from Hamas is now visiting Cairo to discuss with Egypt issues related to the formation of a new Palestinian government by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Khaled Mashaal, a delegation member, told the press on the 8th that although the international community and some Arab countries have been exerting constant pressure, the Palestinian government formed under the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, Mashaal also warned Abbas in his speech not to take the liberty of changing the structure of the Palestinian leadership without first consulting with Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts believe that this is a response to the intention of Abbas to appoint Interior Minister Nasser Yousef as deputy commander of the security troops. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In reply to questions about the establishment of a new Palestinian autonomous government, Mashaal refused to confirm the news that Hamas plans to nominate Al-Khudairi, board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza (and merchant) as prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "The candidate for prime minister has not been decided yet," Mashaal said. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to Meshaal's reiteration of the refusal to recognize Israel, another Hamas political leader, Marzuk, said in an Egyptian TV interview that Hamas would never recognize the legitimate status of Israel, but the new government would contact Israel in various fields, for it's one thing not to recognize Israel and it's another to contact with it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apart from the new and old hatreds between the three Hamas candidates for prime minister and Israel, the issue of territory ... eh ... has always been a difficult problem in Palestine-Israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Acting Israeli Prime Minister Olmert said on the 7th in an interview with Israeli TV II that Israel must be separated from Palestine through the delimitation of permanent borders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This means that Israel will have to pull out from part of the territory on the west bank of the Jordan River. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel would keep its control over large Jewish settlements on the west bank of the Jordan River and the river valley and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="38"> Even though the remains of the three fallen Chinese engineers have left for China, Pakistan's investigation into the attack was still ongoing. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Only one hour ago, at two o'clock Beijing time, Pakistan police met with staff from the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to brief the Chinese on progress in the investigation into the incident. </seg>
<seg id="40"> We will now connect to this station's reporter in Pakistan, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Hello, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Yes, hello.   (()) </seg>
<seg id="43"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In the meeting that was just held.... </seg>
<seg id="45"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="46"> In the briefing just held, what progress in the investigation was explained? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Uh, okay. </seg>
<seg id="48"> As you said, only an hour ago, the police chief from Pakistan's Balochistan province, which is the province where the incident occurred, his name is Yaqoob, he visited the China's [lu ba] consulate-general in Karachi to brief our ambassador to Pakistan, and also the consul general, on the status of the investigation by Pakistani police over the last two days into the incident. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In his briefing, he concisely explained the, uh, primary clues and targets the Pakistani police had in tracking down the assailants. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Eh, they maintain that the incident was probably the act of outsiders but that they surely had ties with some local residents. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Well, eh, they are now focusing on, uh, employees of the company for which the Chinese engineers worked. </seg>
<seg id="52"> They figure that these people might have fed information to the assailants and provided intelligence; for example, intelligence regarding the times the Chinese engineers departed and arrived at various locations. </seg>
<seg id="53"> In addition, they might have provided the assailants cover. </seg>
<seg id="54"> So these various aspects are what the police are currently focusing on. </seg>
<seg id="55"> According to the police chief, after two days of investigation they have questioned more than fifty people. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Presently, the scope of the investigation is gradually shrinking. </seg>
<seg id="57"> In addition, um, after the briefing was over, the police chief and other police officials also at...also went to the memorial hall set up in our country's consulate-general in Karachi to pay their respects to the three victims. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Uh, furthermore, something else of interest occurred. A group called the Balochistan Liberation Army (()) has claimed responsibility for the incident, but this news has not yet been confirmed by Pakistani, uh, authorities. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Uh, in responding to questions from this station's reporters regarding the incident, the police chief said that the %pw, the terrorist group is actually an extremely loose network  that does not have an intact organization. </seg>
<seg id="60"> And, eh, a lot of people become members of the group just by calling themselves members. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Uh, so, as far as the Pakistani authorities are concerned, they, uh, are still focusing the investigation on several actual individuals. </seg>
<seg id="62"> As for the group, uh, they are not regarding it as an especially key aspect. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Okay, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="65"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="66"> Um, we will continue to pay close attention to the status of the investigation into the matter. </seg>

<seg id="30"> Iranian extremists angry at the publication of cartoons of Mohammed once again attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday and threw Molotov cocktails. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, an Iranian state-run paper sought revenge by organizing a contest for cartoons depicting Nazis slaughtering Jews. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The US denounced the initiative as an arrogant attempt to take advantage of the situation to extend the consistent anti-Israeli stance of Iranian President Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Roughly twenty to thirty protestors climbed an enclosure to enter the compound of the Danish embassy in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> A crowd of roughly three hundred outside also threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the building. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Because of the fear that extreme Maoists who have staged evermore frequent rebellions in recent months will infiltrate the border, border troops and militiamen guarding the 200km-long Indian-Nepalese border in Darjeeling County have been reinforced by three battalions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In Nepal's north lay the Himalayas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The other three sides border India, with the border measuring a total of 1,477km. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maoist rebels often sneak into Indian border villages to receive weapons from local allied factions and drug traffickers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Deputy Inspector [Shanaya] of the border troops in the [Lanidanjia] region said they would increase the existing 26 battalions to 36 in order facilitate patrolling of the 100km borderline between Darjeeling County and West Sikkim. </seg>
<seg id="7"> [Shanaya] said it had been reported that Indian Kamtapur Liberation Organization had joined forces with the Maoist rebels in the counties of Jhapa and Ilam in east Nepal. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The border troops will set up 18 border observation posts to further strengthen border security. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Trained police dogs will accompany the border troops on their patrols to detect explosives and drugs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Border officials have also begun to thoroughly check all vehicles and people passing through sensitive border inspection stations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> India is worried that these people may ally with leftwing Indian extremists. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. </seg>

<seg id="15"> After price adjustment, actual growth in GDP in the October-December quarter was up 1.4% from the previous quarter, registering a growth rate that was 1.2% higher than expected. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The primary reasons are strong domestic demand and rising exports to major countries, such as China and the United States. This is a sign of a sustained economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is the fourth quarter in a row that Japan has witnessed economic growth and the highest growth rate since the first and third quarters of 2005. It is primarily due to individual spending, capital expenditure and strong exports. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, Japan's central bank will end in April its  extremely loose currency policy of the past five years, thereby encouraging the financial market's expectations for an economic upturn. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In October through December, nongovernmental consumption increased by 0.8% thanks to a moderate improvement in the unemployment rate and wages. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The NIKKEI climbed after the release of the GDP figures, but was down 0.74% at the close of the morning session. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Immediately following the decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to refer the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has reiterated that ... eh ... there is no room for negotiations with the US, one of the promoters of the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Well ... an Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that the policy Iran has maintained to date in regards to relations with the US is not to engage in discussion or negotiation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said the west has committed a grave error in referring the nuclear issue to the Security Council in an obvious attempt to block the development of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Iran said on Monday that ... eh ... it would discontinue cooperation with IAEA, resume the extraction of enriched uranium and prohibit spot checks of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> So, on this issue, Iran's current attitude is pretty hard-line, ut the attitude of the United States is even more hard-line. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Eh ... US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has repeatedly said that ... eh ... the use of force would not be ruled out in regard to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well ... now there are rumors that the US military is putting such a plan into effect. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are developing a super bomb, called the "Mother of All Bombs". </seg>
<seg id="9"> Eh ... once the Department of Defense gives the go-ahead, this super bomb will be used to blast Iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So, how big exactly is this Mother of All Bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> It has been said that, in terms of weight alone, the bomb weighs 30,000 pounds, equal to the weight of a double-deck bus. Also, its bulk is massive. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Such a super bomb has been developed mainly to bombard certain underground facilities of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Because of its massive penetrating power, it can penetrate concrete and also steel plate. It can roughly create a pit that is half a mile in radius and 60 feet deep, destroying several underground buildings and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So it now seems that in this respect the US has really begun to hone its sword or make the bomb. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumsfeld ... eh... said that, on this issue ... no means would be excluded as a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and a resort to force had been put on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elsewhere, irrespective of the continuous escalation of the Iranian nuclear issue, an Iranian official in China said in an interview with this station that Iran actually would still work with the international community by persisting in peaceful negotiation ... eh ... in the hope of easing the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But he also added that Iran would adjust the details of cooperation with Russia on a nuclear project. </seg>
<seg id="18"> As for the second round of negotiations with Russia regarding the enriched uranium cooperation project scheduled for February 16, the Iranians said that the negotiations would go on as planned, though it was emphasized that the changes that have taken place so far will make it necessary to adjust the content of the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Russia has previously been a steady supporter of Iran's peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and had said that it would remain stick to its position that the Iranian nuclear issue should not be referred to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But, as we can see now, they have agreed to referring the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Given this new development, as a result we may make some changes to the policy we agreed on with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the UN Security Council ultimately decides in March whether to impose economic and political sanctions, Iran will advocate continuous negotiations with related international organizations and, in the meantime, remains willing to cooperate with the international community to ease the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We stress the point that, for purpose of its own economic growth and national construction, Iran will not abandon the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated any related international laws. We hope that the United States too will understand this. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Iranian nuclear issue is completely different from the Afghanistan and Iraqi issues. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the US is pretty clear about that itself. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As for the so-called military strike, we haven't seen any clear-cut expression of attitude on the part of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We don't want to see the further escalation of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Although we also make a point of using peaceful negotiation, we will not bow to pressure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Additionally, ((A ge bi)) also said that he hoped China would continue on the basis of its existing standpoint to cooperate with Iran. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's first take a look at today's headlines. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The US northeast states and the Atlantic coast region were buffeted by the winter's first snowstorm this morning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Snow accumulation in some regions exceeds 60 centimeters </seg>
<seg id="4"> Several airports were forced to close. </seg>
<seg id="5"> More than two-thousand flights have been cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And as for New York, it is the first time in history that it has seen such heavy snowfall. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, this is the second largest snowfall in recorded history. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's take a look at the actual situation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Residents of New York City woke up Sunday morning to find themselves in a world of white. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Outdoors, most buildings and streets were covered with a thick coat of snow. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New York's Central Park recorded 57.9 cm of snowfall. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This is the second largest snowfall on record in the history of New York City. </seg>
<seg id="13"> New York's Mayor Bloomberg said: This was a frightening snowstorm. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Out of safety considerations, he urged people to stay in their homes and not to go outside. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Most flights from New York City's three airports have to be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Some of them won't be resumed until Monday. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The capital Washington is also experiencing a snowstorm, with snowfall having exceeded 50 cm. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Grass and trees have all been draped in white attire. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But President Bush still attended a church service as usual. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Many of the city's resident have also stepped outside their homes in order to take in the beautiful winter scenery and profit from chance to play in the snow. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The National Weather Service's radars show snowfall stretching from eastern Virginia through to Maine. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In New Jersey, New York's Long Island, Connecticut and Maryland, power to homes and businesses was also cut following the snowstorm. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is estimated that more than one-hundred and fifty thousand users are without power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Large areas of Europe are also under the influence of a snowstorm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The state of Bavaria in southern Germany has mobilized thousands of firefighters and soldiers to work with police and volunteers in clearing snowfall from rooftops and roads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Deggendorf region in eastern Bavaria is still under a state of emergency after several days of heavy snow. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Some small villages have lost contact with the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> A roof collapsed under heavy snow in Bad Reichenhall in the state of Bavaria last month, killing fifteen people. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This is a news brief by Phoenix Satellite Television. </seg>
<seg id="30"> New York was of course among the cities affected in the northeast region of the US that was hit by the blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="31"> For the local situation, we will immediately connect with this station's reporter in New York, Luo Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hello, Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hello, Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Hi. </seg>
<seg id="35"> You've just been hit with so much snow, so what is the situation actually like there? </seg>
<seg id="36"> I hear that power has even been cut to some areas. </seg>
<seg id="37"> What areas have been affected? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Yes, that's right. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In fact, the...the area covered by the blizzard is extremely large. </seg>
<seg id="40"> I'm really happy to tell you that now we have finally seen the end of the blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although the, the snowstorm was very violent, it didn't cause any serious injuries or fatalities. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Many states in the area hit in the eastern US  were affected: Maryland received 21 inches of snowfall; Pennsylvania got 19 inches; and the New York-New Jersey area was at more than 24 inches. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Snowflakes could be seen from Virginia to Maine, and even in Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="44"> So, uh, as you just said, the, it resulted in power outages in many locations in the Washington region and Baltimore. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The total...total number of households affected by the power outage is approximately ten thousand or so. </seg>
<seg id="46"> New York is okay. The power outage, uh, power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is normal. There are just some power outages in the Long Island area. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Only snowplows and rescue vehicles such as ambulances are able to circulate on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="49"> As for traffic and transportation, relatively early on the New York, uh, area's three large airports were closed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But, uh, we learned toward the evening that there appeared to be some movement toward resuming activities at Newark Airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia Airport in New York. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So there are some people who estimate that in a few hours from now those airports will open. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Delta Airlines, for example, has announced that all flights to places like Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and the state of Connecticut have been grounded until Monday. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Reagan Airport in Washington DC has already been opened. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Buses in the New York-New Jersey area are currently not running. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Trains are also operating at reduced frequency. </seg>
<seg id="56"> It, uh, it is now Sunday in New York. It is also the Lantern Festival. </seg>
<seg id="57"> And as for we Chinese, normally on the Lantern Festival some local Chinese communities have Lantern Festival activities, but these have all had to be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Likewise, most of the activities that the people of New York normally take part in on Sunday have for the most part been cancelled. And, uh, no one is going outside, that is, they are all staying in their homes. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What is giving everybody a headache now is how to get to work on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The snow removal, or rather the accumulated snow could cause some flooding. </seg>
<seg id="62"> So the, uh, governments of the areas in the US being affected are now studying how to cope with the rush of people heading to work on Monday, as well as the rush of automobiles. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Thank you Xiaoying for this latest report issued from the US. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Since there is nothing to be done, you might as well take a while to peacefully enjoy the beautiful snowscape. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now let's look at some news items about Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Koizumi has been contemplating upgrading the Japan Defense Agency to a Ministry so as to build up Japan's military muscle. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But, heated debates erupted during the process, which ran into one obstacle after another. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, a scandal surfaced involving tenders for engineering projects offered by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, an institution under the Defense Agency. As a result, some former and current officials have been arrested by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, many people advised Koizumi to be careful in his move to upgrade the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And recently, Koizumi said that he had temporarily put the plan on the shelf rather then refer it to the parliament for review. </seg>
<seg id="7"> And he also hopes that the two parties in power can discuss the issue carefully and, eh, continue their consultations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Elsewhere, here is some other news. If you go to Japan, there is now a new rule. </seg>
<seg id="9"> That is, Japan plans to, stipulates that most of tourists arriving in Japan must have their fingerprints and photos taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The move aims to prevent some unsafe individuals from entering Japan's borders and also prevent illegal immigration. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, so, it will probably be more troublesome going to Japan now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Of course, recently there was one good news in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That is, Princess Kiko, wife of the second son of Japanese emperor, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This development has caused many Japanese to hope that she will give birth to a boy who will be heir to the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But, she also threw the imperial family, which has always stayed relatively quiet, into a commotion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Uh, in fact, Kiko is now of course a mature pregnant mother and she has all along been thought to be content with a family of four. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Being pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help conjecturing that, uh, a fraternal scramble for the throne may arise in the imperial household. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, many people are taking delight in talking about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To explain this, one must go back to a few years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Eh, it's like this. At that time, in 2002, because the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito, contracted depression, the imperial household did not place too much hope on them at the time and instead turned to the second prince, Fumihito, whom they put pressure on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At the time, Fumihito did not do much in response. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But, by 2004, the contradiction intensified somewhat after Naruhito, uh, out of his care for his wife, reproached the imperial family on public occasions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is said that the imperial family were furious and asked his peer, Prince Fumihito to stand out and rebut his elder brother, accusing him of showing disrespect for the imperial family and doting upon his wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The brothers have been in discord from then on. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Now, if Prince Fumihito gives birth to a boy, the dominant role they play will become a pillar of the imperial household </seg>
<seg id="26"> and the East Palace, i.e. the crown prince will surely fall out of favor. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Eh, this is why many people say that, if things go on like this, the impact on the imperial household and the Japanese society will be tremendous. </seg>

<seg id="1"> United Nations Secretary General Annan visited the White House on Monday to meet with US President Bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In response to Iran's announcement that it was postponing nuclear talks with Russia, Annan urged Iran to halt nuclear activity as quickly as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Elsewhere, news sources have reported that the US Department of Defense has actually already begun in earnest to devise plans for bombing Iran as a last resort in case diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, outside sources believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council imposing sanctions on Iran, but the two did not make any announcement in that regard following the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Bush and Annan both reiterated that they hoped to resolve the Iran nuclear issue through negotiation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed concern over Iran's initiation of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear talks with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, US media reported, that Pentagon military strategists had begun seriously planning for military action against Iran so that if diplomatic efforts fails the US will use military methods to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reports say that the US Central Command has started pinpointing attack targets. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The attack could possibly be by submarine-launched ballistic missile or B2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On Monday, Annan urged all sides not to take actions that will intensify the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the analysis of some military experts, Iran could be capable of manufacturing a nuclear weapon within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, more than two years remain in Bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will endeavor to resolve the Iran nuclear issue before the end of his term, regardless of whether peaceful or military methods are used. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is reported from Washington by Mou Naiqian of Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the 13th, Iranian President Ahmadinejad said that large superpower states that use their nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ahmadinejad was meeting with the diplomatic envoys of various countries to Tehran on the occasion of the commemoration of the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said the arms race between countries and the fight to achieve hegemony will not bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The hunger of the large superpowers will never be satisfied and they even go as far as to use nuclear weapons to threaten other countries. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But he said that the large superpower countries that rely on nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind will have lasting peace and stability is close at hand. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it can be seen that now, not only the war of words, but in actual truth, the sabre-rattling between Iran and the west and between Iran and the US has become more intense the longer it has gone on. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And because of the uncompromising attitude between Iran and the US, recently there have been certain changes in the situation. That is, Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that it would resume its plan to extract enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some western diplomats speculate that Iran had actually already resumed certain processes in the extraction of enriched uranium prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Iran also announced that it was postponing talks with Russia for an indeterminate period of time. The talks were to deal with Russia taking over the extraction of enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Of course, the postponement for an unlimited duration of the plan to hold talks was also brought about by the new situation that currently exists. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And recently, because the US has continued to threaten that it will attack Iran, the Oxford Research Institute, a British think tank, issued a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the US actually employs military force, it will result in half the people being killed and furthermore would certainly spark a protracted wave of violence in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Also, terrorist attacks would also grow in intensity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The price of oil would without doubt also surge in what would be one part of a domino effect. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Moreover, the report also says that if the US fails to subdue Iran, it will result in Iran resolving to move faster toward manufacturing its own nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="31"> We just spoke about the issue of talks between Russia and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In fact, a spokesman for the Iranian government said on Monday that because the situation had changed, Iran would postpone talks with Russian officials originally scheduled on the 16th regarding the extraction of enriched uranium inside Russia's border. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: No official notice has yet been received from Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It is therefore too early to say if the meeting will be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Furthermore, Russia's federal Atomic Energy Agency and the Commissioner of Energy Resources [Gu Jinuofu] said on Monday: Russian has prepared for talks with Iran on the nuclear issue and the conditions and principles for negotiation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> At the same time, recently the United States' New York Times published an editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The title of the editorial was also very attention-grabbing. It was called Japan's Offensive Foreign Minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The editorial highlighted the fact that Japan's foreign minister, Taro Aso, has recently issued a string of shocking statements. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The statements were all extremely disingenuous and also extremely unwise, and they provoked widespread resentment in Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The editorial likewise made special note of the fact that the Japanese should acknowledge their errors and learn their lesson, rather than, as is currently the case, avoiding mention in post-war educational material of the things they did during the war. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the editorial also says that many of the opinions aired by Taro Aso, such as demanding that the prime minister pay homage at the Yasukuni Shrine and saying that colonial rule improved Taiwan's, uh, that Japanese colonial rule improved Taiwan's educational standards, and so on, that he would make such statements shocked people, and, well, it is clear that he is bereft of any knowledge of history and that his diplomatic skills are also extremely poor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The New York Times had the third largest circulation in the US last year. It can therefore be considered influential in US society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> So this editorial should also have quite an effect. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, some former senior officials in the US government as well as some specialists in Asian issues have started a special discussion forum, that is, a discussion forum on Sino-Japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the discussion forum, some specialist put forth the following viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They said Sino-Japanese relations were currently in a very tense period and that there was a potential danger of armed  conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, they said that the possibility of armed conflict breaking out between China and Japan was currently even greater than that of armed conflict over the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Uh, and once armed conflict breaks out, the US will definitely be dragged into it because the US is certain to become involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also participated in the forum said that Sino-Japanese relations were in truth at a very tense stage currently. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Any mistake could lead to serious consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elsewhere, the Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security held a general meeting and decided to eject the Russian peacekeeping troops that are in the South Ossetia region. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Russia's parliament will hold a general assembly today in order to deliberate the proposal. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Uh, specialists say that if the proposal to expel Russian peacekeepers is approved, it could lead to a complete breakdown in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two military food-transport vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force were blocked by Georgian police and the driver was expelled. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Uh, the spokesman demanded that Georgia immediately halt such provocative activities, otherwise Russia would not bear responsibility for the consequences stemming from the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The two military vehicles transporting grain and non-staple foods and belonging to the logistical system of the Russian peacekeeping forces were inspected on Monday night by Georgian police in the South Ossetia region of Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The on-duty Georgian police expelled the Russian driver and the detained personnel and forcibly removed the two military vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident has angered the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1 the Georgian police confiscated a military vehicle in the region on the basis of a traffic accident. The truck has not yet been returned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, it again used a visa problem as a reason to detain three Russian officers for two full days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Georgia's arbitrary acts of provocation aim to cause a bloody incident in the region and force the Russian soldiers to fire their weapons, so that the peacekeeping force will withdraw from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The same day, Russia's ambassador to Georgia issued an urgent petition to the Georgians, demanding that Georgia immediately halt its insane provocation, otherwise Russia would not be responsible for any conflict that resulted from it. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Media reported that on February 13 Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold the South Ossetians a number of  missiles used in Strela-type portable anti-aircraft missile systems. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On the same day, the Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security held a general assembly and, after hearing a report by the law-enforcement department, decided to expel the Russian peacekeepers inside Georgia's border and ask the general parliamentary assembly on the 14th to deliberate on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Specialists believe that once the final decision is made, it could lead to a final and complete breakdown in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Prior to this, Georgian Minister of Minister of Foreign Affairs Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and rejected Russian President Putin's discourse that if the west recognized Kosovo, Russia might recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia, saying that the Russian government was sending out encouraging signals to all separatist regions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Prior to this, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that it would protect Russians in South Ossentia, thereby implying a threat of military force directly against Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Admiral Roughead, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, announced on Tuesday that this summer the US ... eh ... would dispatch four aircraft carriers to the Asia-Pacific region to hold the largest military exercise in the past decade. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead also said that the US ... eh ... would not view China as a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The US military hopes to be able to hold joint exercises with the PLA navy again. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This statement immediately aroused the attention of US defense experts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On Wednesday, the American think-tank the Heritage Foundation held a workshop on the Pentagon's Defense Review. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The subtle relationship between the report and the military exercise became one of the focuses of discussion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some people hold that Roughead's open invitation to China to take part in the exercise is an olive branch held out to China by the US. </seg>
<seg id="8"> While inviting China to take part in the exercise, the US military also expressed the hope that the operations of PLA would be more transparent. Therefore, some defense experts believe that this is evidence that the Pentagon is unclear about China's intention to expand its military force and hopes to use the joint military exercise as an opportunity for mutual probing and sounding out. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Furthermore, because the Defense Review released by the Pentagon early this month regards China as the greatest potential threat in the future, two defense experts have pointed out that the Asia-Pacific military exercise is the first step taken by the US Department of Defense to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is reported by Xie Xiaoshuang of Phoenix TV from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore, ... eh ... the military exercise held by the US this summer is being watched carefully because this is the first time in the past decade that the US ... eh ... will have four aircraft carriers in a military exercise at the same time and also the first time since the Vietnam War that the US will move aircraft carriers from its east coast to the western Pacific region for such a military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And the military exercise ... eh ... actually, it is carried out frequently,  and will occur four times in these few months ... </seg>
<seg id="13"> Eh...one of them will be a multinational military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This multinational military exercise will include Japan, South Korea and Australia. </seg>

<seg id="19"> Following the incident, a local armed group called the Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that the Chinese engineers had been killed because they were collaborating with the Pakistani government in stealing the mineral resources of the local tribal inhabitants. </seg>

<seg id="32"> Moreover, Chinese President Hu Jintao  learned late on the night of the 15th that a gun attack on Chinese engineers and technicians in the Pakistani province of Balochistan had resulted in three deaths. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Eh...after learning the news, he expressed deep concern for the safety of Chinese technical personnel working in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Then, Hu Jintao, he immediately instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China's embassy and consulates in Pakistan to pressure the Pakistani authorities to apprehend the assailants, ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan and, eh, appropriately handle arrangements related to those who were killed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Hu Jintao also expressed profound sorrow for the tragic deaths of the Chinese personnel and expressed his sincere condolences to their families. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Okay, regarding this issue, we are now going to contact Chen Yiming, reporter for the People's Daily in Islamabad, in order to find out the newest developments. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Hello, Mr. Chen. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Can you give us the newest developments in the investigation into the shooting deaths of Chinese engineers? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Eh, yes, Anchorman. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Eh, from what I've been able to learn from the Chinese consulate-general in Karachi regarding the situation, the...eh...Chinese embassy and consulate have, uh, informed the unit to which the victim's belonged of the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> And, eh, according to standard procedure, then, uh, arrangements for the victim's remains should be carried out after consulting with their work unit and their, uh, families. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Furthermore, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement yesterday. </seg>

It also says, um, the Pakistani authorities would do everything they could to prevent the reoccurrence of similar incidents. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Um, in addition, according to a report on the evening of the 15th by Pakistan's privately-owned television station GEO, the CEO of the Attock Cement Factory in Pakistan, Bashir, said that evening during, eh, in an interview with that station that in the aftermath of the attack Pakistan would organize as soon as possible the repatriation of the remaining eleven Chinese engineers and technicians working on the construction of the cement project. </seg>
<seg id="46"> And this Bashir also said during the interview that, in regard to questions by Pakistani media as to why, uh, at the time of the incident the Chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel, uh, he said, eh, that in actuality the cement plant where the engineers worked had its own security system but that because the location of the incident was still within the limits of the factory area there were no accompanying security personnel when the incident took place. </seg>
<seg id="47"> He expressed his extreme regret over the tragic incident. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Anchorman. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Um, okay. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Uh, in addition, this is actually not the first time that Chinese engineering personnel have been killed in attacks in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="51"> A similar incident occurred in October 2004. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in South Waziristan. </seg>
<seg id="53"> In the end, one of the individuals was tragically killed in the rescue operation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Also, three engineers were killed in a bomb attack in Gwador in May of the same year. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Let's take a look back. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On May 3, 2004, in the port of Gwador in the south of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, a vehicle carrying twelve Chinese headed toward a worksite at the port was hit by a car bomb attack. </seg>
<seg id="57"> As a result, three Chinese engineers were killed and nine individuals were injured. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Local armed separatists and tribal militants are believed to have launched the attack. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by armed militants in the area of South Waziristan in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> A short while after, one engineer was fatally shot as Pakistani troops were rescuing the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, it is believed that the hostage-taking was carried out by armed militants linked to Al Qaeda and not armed separatists. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Because China has close economic ties with Pakistan and participates in infrastructure projects in that country, several Chinese engineers work there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> On the other hand, there are also armed tribal groups in Pakistan that accuse the government of plundering their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> This has resulted in Chinese becoming the victims of attacks or kidnappings on several occasions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's take a look at some news items from  Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Recently, Japan's political arena produced some rather sensational news. </seg>
<seg id="3"> That is, Tsuneo Watanabe, chairman of one of Japan's leading papers, the Yomiuri Shimbun, he ordered Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles ...eh ... that oppose Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, marking Yomiuri Shimbun's shift to a stand against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Eh ... so ... this Tsuneo Watanabe ..., in the speech he made a few days ago, he also lashed out at Koizumi ..., saying that he is ignorant and has no historical and cultural knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the same time, he commented that visiting Yasukuni Shrine was just like paying tribute to Hitler and said that, in so doing, Koizumi ... eh ... had caused China and South Korea to ... eh ... regard Japan as a very dangerous country. This will bring endless troubles. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So why has Tsuneo Watanabe's attitude caused such a  repercussion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, he is very influential in political circles and has always been a major behind-the-scenes operator. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And he used to be a very rightist figure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It should be said that he has always been a supporter of the hawks and strongly advocated revision of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But, now, ... well ... this is really a major turn-around. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He turned his gun and ... eh ... opened fire  on Koizumi, adopting an attitude of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, in 2004, when Koizumi was being criticized for visiting Yasukuni Shrine, this Tsuneo Watanabe ... he ... eh ... he said that he supported it and wanted Koizumi to withstand the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Recently, however, he made a speech, saying: "I am over 80 years old and don't have many days left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> So, he now stands up to make a high-profile speech with a very opposing attitude. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such a turnaround of course produced a significant impact on the entire Japanese society. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just as Tsuneo Watanabe himself put it, he said: "I am convinced that I have the strength to control and change the direction of the political winds." </seg>
<seg id="17"> And he also said that he would put up a desperate resistance if the government pressured Yomiuri Shimbun with respect to its freedom of speech or its ability to interview. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So, what has the situation come to now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Well, Japan's largest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, and the second largest newspaper, Asahi Shimbu...eh, these two leading newspapers have started to team up in opposition to Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, the two papers were opponents, but after the two chairmen met, they were able to reach agreement on this issue at least. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Therefore, they have now launched a campaign of considerable scale to criticize Koizumi. You can say that they have formed an ideal combination. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Actually, these two large newspapers have great sway over mainstream public opinion in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In a separate development, let's look at the meeting of the Japanese parliament. At a recent meeting, two candidates favored to succeed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same type of remarks. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who were the two? </seg>
<seg id="25"> One was Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe and the other was Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Aso, who of late has frequently made astonishing remarks. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What did the two say? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They said that Japanese war criminals of the Second World War were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they mean is ... eh ... that, they claimed that these criminals ... it was the intention of the international court to convict them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But, in Japan, according to international laws ... they were citing the domestic laws of Japan ... eh ... the war criminals ... did not break the domestic laws of Japan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So, they think that, in Japan, World War II criminals should not be regarded as criminals. </seg>
<seg id="31"> This Shinzo Abe ... he also mentioned that Japan now ... eh ... should take the whole world into account, develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with some East Asian countries, and, furthermore, it should also try to develop closer ties with India rather than always focus on China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Chance at the Championship, But It's Not a Sure Thing </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Love life, love Lu Neng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The China Football Association Super League is set for some fierce battles. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Luneng Taishan is getting combat-ready for the new season with the championship in mind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Hot competitions will be triggered between the Dalian, Shandong and Shanghai teams, the three strongest competitors for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the end, who will win the championship? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on an analysis of their strengths, Taishan has a very good chance to become champion, but it is by no means a sure thing. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First of all, the new team members have not had long enough to get worked in. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Taishan lost at four major events last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This year, Taishan recruited two players from the national team--Li Leilei and Wang Liang. With the addition of two foreign players soon afterwards, it is safe to say that the team will be stronger. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But because the national football team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq, there no way to say how well the two players from the national team will integrate. </seg>
<seg id="12"> By the time they return to the club, league matches will be set to begin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That is why integration has become the most significant issue Taishan is facing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In my view, the national-team players can be used as backups in the first few rounds of league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, team integration can be achieved using the in-game training. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Second, the national-team players who have just played group matches with the national team can use the lull to rest up. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After a few rounds, when the "knife is well sharpened', it will not be too late for them to play top spots. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the defense has some weaknesses. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Last year, Taishan's fans had some unfavorable things to say about the team's defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This year, the defense will have improved with the recruitment of Li Leilei. But it's still not the time to sit back and relax. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There's still the problem of sluggish turnaround at the center back position, and the substitutes for this position are either too old or lacking in experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If performance at the center back position can be stabilized, Taishan will gain some momentum on the road to becoming champion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In my opinion, they might as well use Ren Yongshun, who is strong physically. Although he lacks experience, he should be put to work this year so as to be ready in the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Gao Yao can play center back as well. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Taishan has quite a few players who can play defending midfield, such as Cui Peng and Hai Bing. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Yao is physically very strong and a ferocious interceptor. He should be able to handle the center back position. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Another question is whether the foreign recruits can adjust. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Taishan has been plagued by problems with foreign recruits. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The performance of Daniel [Daniel Danciulescu] last year was far from stellar. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We know that this year's selection of foreign players has not yet been finalized. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that apart from bringing in an excellent striker, a true left-footed midfielder should also be recruited this year. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except for Xing Rui, who played for the team a few years ago, Taishan has not had a true left-footed player with good skills. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although players like Cui Peng and other can play the position, a truly competent left half back would be greatly preferred to fill-in. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three issues can be solved, Taishan's road to the championship should be somewhat smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Shandong football fan, I'm really hoping Taishan can win the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> But to be frank, with things looking like they do in the championships this year, Taishan has a good chance, but it is far from a sure thing. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  BrandVista Post: </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Hello, everybody. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Once again, the Chinese New Year has flown by and those who combined their vacation time with their New Year's holiday are now returning to their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We wish all our friends a happy New Year, if it is not too late to say Happy New Year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We spoke recently at a cafe with NPLCN. He talked about present-day Brandvista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The appearance of the website has improved greatly. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The content is well structured. </seg>
<seg id="9"> What pleases him most is the Discuz-powered community BBS, which has undergone a thorough revamping. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In regards to the community, I must thank one person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> That is, Mr. Li Mingshun, general manager of Discuz Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If you search for his name in Google, you will get a slew of hits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> You probably know that he was previously with Sina. He later started his own business, setting up an Internet advertisement exchange platform for SMEs that was similar to the overseas website Adbrite.com. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We discussed it with him at the time on MSN. What he said, in general, was that: Brandvista felt that the development of many industries in China depended on the expansion of the private economy and SMEs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And currently, in the Chinese market, this situation does not give reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So SME's in creative industries and similar services are unable to provide consultation to any significant extent. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Collecting high fees to advance one's own development in the end leads to a discouraging cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later, he came to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is an outstanding forum program powered by PHP and MySQL. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer from Beijing, Brandvista finally saw the light of day once again and hit the stage with matchless freshness. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The feedback was very good. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The interface was neat and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was also very fast. </seg>
<seg id="24"> With the neat interface, writing a few words that moved me and inspired others, exchanging tidbits about work and life with friends from the same industry that shared the same pursuits, I began to find that this was a pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thank you Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> Recently, there has been a lot of news from the advertising industry. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Starting in January, the WTO system of openness in the ad industry began to be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Large foreign companies have been arriving one after another. Small foreign companies are sharpening their sword for battle. It seems to be a scene of prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Batey Ads, which rose to prominence in Singapore, has been having many difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Having lost a string of big clients and having suffered repeated setbacks in its development in mainland China, Martin Boase finally took a little time from a lawsuit in Italy to think about shuffling things around. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Batey Ads will merge into JWT's network, keeping its own brandname and being managed by JWT. </seg>
<seg id="32"> However, at the same time, there were also rumors that Bates and 141 Network would merge into the Ogilvy and Mather system and be managed by the Ogilvy and Mather network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Even if 141 had already given its report to Ogilvy and Mather prior to that, having Ted Bates get payback against Ogilvy and Mather is also a interesting matter. </seg>
<seg id="34"> During the Spring Festival, several articles on the website were updated. We won't go into each one here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Everybody can go to the website to take a look when they have time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, friends who still haven't entered the new forum can, with a few extra clicks of a mouse, enter into Brandvista's completely new community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> You can get a feel for the environment, get to know the atmosphere and contribute a few words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We hope you will find pleasure in finding the group. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We wish all friends a pleasant mood. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Goodbye. </seg>

<seg id="3"> I saw this article and decided to share it with you; </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is not a momentary impulse, but rather a warm kindheartedness that has long existed in the heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I asked myself what I would do if it were me. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The answer is very clear. I would way, "You have the wrong number" and hang up the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I've been thinking all this year about how one can actually help someone. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have already given up on actions such as donating money or goods. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A couple days ago a friend said, "I already have no spare time to take care of myself. As for helping people, the heart is there by the means are not." </seg>
<seg id="10"> Have a nice day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> A Mother Ten Years in the Past </seg>
<seg id="13"> It was a day ten years ago. The teacher was using the lunch break to nap at home, when suddenly the telephone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She answered and heard an unfamiliar rough voice from the receiver: "Your child stole a book and we caught her. Come over right away!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> The crying of a little girl could also be heard though the receiver, as well as the sound of somebody nearby scolding her. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She turned her head to look at her only daughter watching the television and then immediately understood what was happening. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Clearly, a little girl had been caught by a store clerk stealing a book and did not want her family to find out, so she dialed a number at random and happened to call there. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, she could hang up and forget about it, or even reprimand the party on the other line, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this affair had absolutely nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But she was a teacher, and it could be that it was one of her students. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Through the telephone, she could roughly imagine that the little girl who had made a mistake on the spur of the moment was surely terrified, since she was facing what could be life's most frightening circumstance. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After hesitating a moment, a thought suddenly came to her mind. Yes, she would do it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thereupon, after asking the bookstore's address, she rushed over there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Just as she had anticipated, standing in the bookstore was a little girl with a face full of tears. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The adults beside her were ferociously and loudly scolding her. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She instantly rushed forward and gathered the pitiful little girl into her arms, then turned toward the nearby store clerk and said: "Whatever you have to say you can say to me. You shouldn't frighten children." </seg>
<seg id="27"> During the muttering of the somewhat unwilling store clerk, she paid the fine of less than one hundred yuan and then, with the little girl in hand, walked out of the store where she could see clearly the face overwhelmed by panic and tears. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She smiled and returned home with the little girl where she tidied her up without asking anything, then let the little girl leave, </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the little girl was about to go, she also made a point of urging, "If you want to read a book, then come here to Auntie's house. There are lots of books here.' </seg>
<seg id="30"> The still badly shaken little girl looked are her deeply for a moment, then dashed off, after which she never came back. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time rushed by like running water. Imperceptibly, ten years went by in a flash. </seg>
<seg id="32"> She had forgotten the incident, still living there as before, she led a calm and peaceful life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One afternoon, there was a knocking on the outside door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Opening the door to her apartment, she saw a pretty young woman she did not know. The girl was smiling broadly and in her hands she held a stack of presents. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked with uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The young girl excitedly gave a long explanation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> To her surprise, from the unfamiliar young lady's story she suddenly realized that the young woman was actually the little girl from that year. Ten years later, she had graduated from university without difficulty and had now come especially to call on her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The young woman's eyes glistened with tears as she said in a gentle voice: "Although I still don't understand even today why you were willing to pass yourself off as my mother and come to my rescue, but for the last ten years I had a constant feeling that I wanted to cry out 'Mother' to you." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes started to cloud over as well. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Somewhat curious, she asked: "If I hadn't helped you that day, what would have been the result?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> The young woman's face instantly darkened and she lightly shook her head, saying: "I'm not sure. Maybe I would have gone on doing stupid things, or I might even have died." </seg>
<seg id="43"> A violent shiver went through the teacher's heart, then she rejoiced to  herself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The impetuous decision that she had made back then had unexpectedly had such an influence on a person's entire life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smile on the young woman's face, she also began to smile. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Military Observation: How Long Can Iran Hold Out under US Air Attacks? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If we describe conventional war of attrition as causing the opponent to bleed to death, then from the outset modern warfare consists of shooting a gun toward the opponent's head in order to render him a "vegetable" even before there is time to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The disparity between the military capabilities of Iran and the US is not one of quantity, but rather in the understanding of modern war. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which fought a victorless eight-year war with Iraq, seems not yet to have understood the true significance of modern hi-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Following an analysis of US military deployments, Britain's "International Intelligence--Commentary" recently said that the US military is carrying out preparations to launch a large scale air assault on Iran...... </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current status of Iran's air force is cause for concern. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The present situation of Iran's air force is quite similar to that of Iraq's air force prior to the 2003 war. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The country does not possess the capacity to research and develop modern weapons on its own and is also under an arms embargo imposed by the west. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Once war breaks out, it is uncertain whether the antiquated planes in Iran's air force will be able to take to the air to engage US forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At present, Iran's air-defense system consists primarily of an air force belonging to Iran's regular forces, the land-based air-defense force and the air-defense capacity of the revolutionary guard. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Of these, Iran's air force presently has a manpower of 50,000 and more than 300 aircraft of various models. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The most important aircraft models include US-manufactured F-4 Phantoms, F5 Tigers, F-14 Tomcats and Russian-manufactured Mig-29s. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The land-based air-defense force is primarily equipped with surface-to-air missiles of the US-manufactured Hawk series and the British Rapier series, as well as a portion belong to the Russian-manufactured SAM series. </seg>
<seg id="15"> With regards to the current status of Iran's air-defense strength,  analysis by individuals such as the US military expert Harold Hutchison and  military expert [Hela Muqixin] of the [Russian Political and Military Research Institute] indicates that, viewed from the present situation, there are still holes in Iran's air-defense capabilities and air-defense system. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchison says that with respect to overall capabilities, Iran's air force simply is not on the same level as the US air force. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A large number of the US-manufactured jetfighters that Iran is equipped with cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and upgrading. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The F-14 fighter was once the trump card of Iran's air force, but today there are only ten or so that are able to fly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The dependability in actual combat of the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles they carry, known for their ultra-long distance attack capabilities, is also doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="20"> [Hela Muqixin] points out however that the air-defense missile systems provided to Iran by the US in the 1970s and 1980s have lost their warfare capabilities because of a lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In addition, the other non-systematic air-defense weapons obtained from Russia and other countries are simply incapable of countering US forces possessing powerful electromagnetic countermeasure capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Scraping Together a Military Affects Battle Capability </seg>
<seg id="23"> Clearly, Iran's government is also aware that its fate in a conflict depends upon whether it can defend the sky above and it has been carrying out eleventh-hour preparations by scraping together whatever it can find in order to build up its air-defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> At present, its methods can be summarized into two devices: </seg>
<seg id="25"> The first is an all-out effort to conceal key nuclear facilities and beef up their defense capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to a report in the British newspaper The Times, Iran has hidden the Natanz Nuclear Facility, the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Center and other core components of their nuclear facilities eighteen meters underground and added a two-meter thick concrete protection shell. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But the US military is one step ahead. As early as the 1991 Persian Gulf War, it saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in anti-aircraft defense and rushed to develop various types of earth-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After ten years of focused research, the US military has a full complement of strategies and weapons to counter reinforced underground bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Iran has recently also bought a large amount of advanced air-defense weapons from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the end of last year, Iran's government has reached a series of agreements with Russia to purchase Pechora-2A air defense missile systems as well as 29 Tor-M1 air-defense missile systems valued at US$700m. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, modern warfare is a contest of system against system. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The various air-attack weapons of the US military have all been developed by the country itself for its own benefit and, through many years of perfectioning in actual combat, they have been molded into an impressive war machine. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On the other hand, Iran's "up-to-date weapons" have been scraped together from other countries. Whether or not they can be made combat effective in such a short time is still in question. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Iran's Lags Behind Not Only in Weapons </seg>
<seg id="35"> The concept of "air-land battle" was first raised in "Operations", published by the US military in 1982. It stresses reliance on strength in the air to carry out attacks against the enemy's strategically valuable targets. This paralyses the other side's command systems at the start of the war and turns the enemy's conventional forces, even if they are superior, into a "slab of meat on a cutting board." </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War, the US military did not concern itself with how many planes the opponent had, but rather the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Even if Iran's government has prepared for a possible air attack and has begun to take steps to reinforce its air-defense capabilities, Iran, which fought to a stalemate in an eight-year war with Iraq, seems not to have fully understood the true meaning of modern hi-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the progress of the US military's military transformation in recent years, the US military's air-attack operations are completely different from the carpet bombing of the Vietnam War and instead rely on full-depth air assaults with various hi-tech weapons and modern information technology. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Faced with this kind of air assault, how long Iran's land-based air defense systems can hold out is an unknown. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Joining Hands with Google to Battle Microsoft: Will Dell Charge Microsoft "Top-Shelf Fees"? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Dell Inc. (US: DELL) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is currently testing PCs installed with Google's software pack. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This step could form a significant threat to Microsoft's (MicrosoftCorp., MSFT) dominant position in the PC software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Dell spokesman Jess Blackburn said the company is currently evaluating Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After the software has been installed, the PC-user will be able to use the software to conduct searches on the Internet as well as search through information stored on the PC. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn confirmed that the software being evaluated by the company includes a Google-supported Dell homepage, a Google desktop search tool and a Google tool bar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, Google spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that the company was working with Dell in testing a software bundle developed by Google. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Earlier, a report in the Wall Street Journal had said that IT upstart Google was in talks with Dell and Hewlett-Packard in an attempt to convince the computer manufacturing giants to install Google software in their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to an insider quoted by the Wall Street Journal, in order to achieve this end, Google may have to pay up to US$3bn over the next three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the two companies have not disclosed any relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, HP still refuses to issue a comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Microsoft spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above information. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Currently, Microsoft is planning to launch a search tool for the next generation of its Windows operating system and strengthen the development of its online business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the day of the news statement, shares in Google fell another 4.46% to US$367.92. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shares in Microsoft fell that day by 1% to close at US$26.94. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts say that Google is eagerly seeking to expand in a direction beyond web searching and that linking up with Dell and other PC giants could prompt Google to threaten Microsoft in its core businesses. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Matt Rosoff, analyst with the market research firm Directions on Microsoft, says that Microsoft is unquestionably concerned and worried by Google's eagerness to expand into other sources of revenue. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But other analysts strongly disagree. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Charles Di Bona, analyst with market research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, says that it is still too early to talk about Google shaking Windows' dominate position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reporter Handbook: Is Google shaking up Microsoft's landscape? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hui Zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> Without doubt, the computer has become a necessity in modern man's life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But while everybody has become familiar with operating computers, only a small portion of people understand the working principles behind a computer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Just like with an "idiot" camera, if the interface is friendly and the software is convenient and quick to use, the vast majority of "newbies" can find their way around the black box that is a computer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For this reason, the software originally installed by the PC manufacturer more often than not determines the usage habits of most consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Indeed, it was through this measure that Microsoft took firm hold of the market for PC operating systems. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Now, Microsoft's new rival, Google, also intends to use this method to take a piece of the pie. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In regards to this, a well-known organization in the Taiwanese economic media recently made an interesting analogy. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Dell, HP and other computer manufacturers are starting to treat the computers they produce as supermarket shelves and they are charging 'top shelf fees' to software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The winning bidder can cause its software to appear in the 'crucial ten minutes' after the user turns on the new computer and thereby induce the consumer to use their product. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This type of fee method is like the top-shelve fees charged by supermarkets to food companies." </seg>
<seg id="33"> Without doubt, this phenomenon indicates that Microsoft's control is being shaken. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Microsoft's managers have warned Bill Gates, saying that if Google starts paying money to PC manufacturers in order to have computers shipped with Google software installed, then Microsoft's position as overlord will ultimately be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Whatever the final outcome, Microsoft's easy days safely perched at the top of the ladder might become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, keeping a market is much more difficult than creating a market。 </seg>

<seg id="3"> The Sword of Righteousness: Outlook for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: Sword of Righteousness </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember that at the beginning of 2005 Hong Kong's Apple Daily carried an article titled "Falun Rotates Continuously and Its Gong May Be Able to Defeat a Regime". </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article states that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced triumphantly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article lists examples of various occasions and situations where suppression of the Falun Gong movement by mainland China's overseas officials failed and relates how Falun Gong practitioners speaking the truth around the world have caused mainland China to completely lose face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But 2004 doesn't seem to have been anything special when compared to the powerful momentum of 2005's Withdraw-from-the-Party Movement, which was caused by the book Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So, what will 2006 bring? </seg>
<seg id="10"> We can probably get a hint of how this year will develop from two events that occurred at the start of the year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One was the publication of "On Eliminating Evil" by the creator of Falun Gong. The article pronounced that, following July 20, 1999, the final days of mainland China's secret agents were nigh. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As for this article, many people may half believe it or disbelieve it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But regardless of whether it is believed or not, history and facts will prove it! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, the Chinese Communist Party's secret agents are like rats that live in the sewers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their "natural or accidental" death will not attract the attention of society and public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But the large scale striking down or repentance of the CCP's overseas secret agents will inevitably deliver a heavy blow and a great shock to the power-wielding strata of the CCP. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Frightened by the awe-inspiring threat of being struck down, they have no choice but to carefully consider their own means of escape and survival---withdrawing from the Party, defecting and fighting against the CCP. </seg>
<seg id="18"> For this reason, the CCP's "ultra-stable bureaucratic organization", held together by squalid self interest, will start to move toward shakiness, disintegration and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> Another event was the human-rights hunger-strike protest movement launched by Gao Zhisheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It erupted suddenly and initially wasn't well-regarded, but it unexpectedly received an enthusiastic response from around the world as well as a collective response from people from all walks of life and various influential bodies. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this movement can become a bond bringing together the suffering people and various influential bodies fighting for justice, and can be made stronger, then there might be hope that the outside force that deals the final blow to  the CCP, an evil regime in a very precarious situation, may take shape from here. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If it can be said that 2005 was the year that the Communist Party was destroyed at the spiritual level, then in 2006 things will have entered into the stage where the Communist Party is destroyed at the spiritual and material level. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Following further dissemination of the Nine Commentaries and growth in the wave of withdrawals from the party, the disintegration of the CCP and the consolidation of external forces fighting for justice, the countdown has begun for the end of the lifespan of the fiendish CCP! </seg>
<seg id="24"> The will of heaven and the will of the people have merged. The strength of the spirits and the strength of man are joining together. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The heavenly sword is pointing straight at the demon CCP! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If it can be said that 2004 was a year of marching forward in militant song and 2005 was a year of moving forward with great momentum, then what will be the closing assessment of  2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it is an earthshaking radical change and triumphant return in victory! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Title: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, Party Secretary of the Linyi CPC Municipal Committee--By Using Hooligan Tactics, You Will Harm Yourselves Too. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Website of origin: yjrg.net (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), current website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> As of yesterday, the government of Linyi, of which you are the leader, has held Chen Guangcheng under illegal house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You have joined with hooligan and gangland elements to illegally imprison a law-abiding citizen who is completely blind. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You have cut his home's telephone line and installed mobile phone interrupters in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On several occasions, you have also beat him or members of his family. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Your barbaric acts have transgressed the lowest limits of civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the beginning of October, 2005, you employed hooligan gangland tactics to beat the lawyer Li Fangping and myself, but we have been patient and have always done our best to understand the difficult situation you are in. For a period of time, we even tolerated that you had placed Chen Guangcheng under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But 165 days have gone by and you still haven't restrained yourselves. On the contrary, you have intensified your efforts. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You have dispatched large contingents of police and thugs to harass the villagers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You have continued to arrest and beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You have gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, as you continue to organize underworld thugs to surround Chen Guangcheng, we clearly warn you that thuggish underworld tactics will in turn come back to hurt you. </seg>
<seg id="18"> You need to rethink this affair from its beginning. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Province wide, Linyi ranks last in planned parenthood. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As municipal party secretary, it is understandable that you are somewhat anxious. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But you are mistaken in your belief that the people of Linyi are of such low upbringing that it is necessary to use violence and coercion to implement state laws and policies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If citizens do not act in concert with the actions of government, in the end whose fault is it? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it because the citizens are of low upbringing or is it because for a long time the government has engaged in so much lying and deception that its public credibility is too low? </seg>
<seg id="24"> Assuming that ten years ago the same type of actions by government didn't seem so outrageous, don't you feel that, in 2005, when Chinese society has made clear progress and human-rights guarantees have been written into the constitution, your savage acts seem ludicrous? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Think about it for a moment. How is it that only you people in Linyi dare to act this way? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How is it that only you people in Linyi are unable to enforce the law using democratic and legal methods? </seg>
<seg id="27"> In the wake of the reports by Chen Guangcheng and other courageous citizens regarding the savage enforcement of laws, the brave intercedence by Teng Biao and other legal personnel to protect the rights of citizens, as well as the conclusions drawn from the investigation by the State Family Planning Commission, the city of Linyi could have, in good faith, offered an explanation and reached a compromise with the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> When all is said and done, family planning is a difficult problem that is specific to China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Likewise, we can all empathize with the difficult situation you are in. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But you nevertheless went on to employ outrageous measures--arresting Chen Guangcheng and bringing him back from Beijing to be held prisoner, then attempting to have him found guilty of illegally revealing state secrets. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you find it quite ludicrous to accuse a blind man from a poor mountain village of that crime? </seg>
<seg id="32"> Actually, if you had truly corrected your errors, if you had acted correctly, would you fear the criticism of a blind man? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Did you have to send several dozen people to keep watch over him twenty-four hours a day and, flustered and exasperated, even have him accused of a crime? </seg>
<seg id="34"> On October 4, 2005, Attorney Li Fangping and I arrived in Dong Shigu Village. We put forth a very clear position in the hope of resolving the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We suggested that we could first talk with your officials to see what thoughts and demands you had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We took the initiative of suggesting that we could help you persuade Chen Guangcheng that there are some things he should not say. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We hoped that you would not treat a blind person in such a manner. There should be concessions from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But your decision-makers clung obstinately to their course. Furthermore, you unexpectedly came up with a "careful plan"--beating us and detaining us illegally. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think you can intimidate us in this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We haven't done anything illegal, </seg>
<seg id="41"> so we have nothing to fear. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Although the rule of law in China may not be perfect, but neither is it at the point of lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="43"> If you think you can use thuggish tactics to intimidate us, then you have greatly underestimated our determination and perseverance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> If we want, there are many of us with abundant legal justifications to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat a lawyer or an academic once, twice, three times, and each time there will be widespread attention and reporting. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you really dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Isn't it your official position that you are so worried about? </seg>
<seg id="48"> If the beatings actually result in somebody being injured, will your position be so assured? </seg>
<seg id="49"> You don't listen to our rational advice, but instead resort to low-class ruffian tactics. Don't you find this very foolish and also very dangerous? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to make it clear to you that there is a large group of outstanding citizens in China that are devoted to the just adherence to the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We are not afraid of ruffian criminal elements. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We will not tolerate the brazen trampling of the lowest limits of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you go too far, we will confidently and calmly step forward, group after group, to welcome your clubs until the moment that you shrink back. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You should understand clearly that the use of hooligan tactics is in no way a good thing for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Don't think that after you retreat behind the scenes you will be able to break off your involvement with those local ruffians that beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Finally, we also want to remind you that you should treat Chen Guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Blind since childhood, he graduated from collegial studies in Chinese medicine and then taught himself law and English. In the past, he brought legal action against the Beijing Subway Company in order to fight for the rights of blind people and also had running water installed for the villagers. He has become known near and far as "Attorney Chen". </seg>
<seg id="58"> You have unexpectedly mobilized unabashed flunkies to spread rumors and slander him on the Internet and have attempted to have him sentenced with the crime of illegally providing secrets to foreigners. Don't you think that in doing so you have gone too far? </seg>
<seg id="59"> Your house arrest of Chen Guangcheng is illegal. It is also dangerous for you yourself. </seg>
<seg id="60"> At first, you were fully capable of releasing him. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Inasmuch as the savage enforcement of the law had already ceased, he could criticize all he wanted, but how long would he go on? </seg>
<seg id="62"> But you are now steadily denigrating your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Until Cheng Guangcheng obtains his freedom, you will not have a day of peace. </seg>
<seg id="64"> You have persecuted him enough. </seg>
<seg id="65"> If you try to have him convicted of a crime or attempt to use further thuggish tactics, we will not fold our arms and stand by. </seg>

<seg id="3"> With great disappointment, I admit that the Chinese nation does not deserve democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Isn't this what the people posting articles here have been doing? </seg>
<seg id="5"> The pity is that there won't be many people (compared to a population of 1.4 billion) coming online to read them. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And there are even fewer people among the web surfers who care about or take part in such topics. I dare say, less than 1% of them! </seg>
<seg id="7"> Let alone the fact that this network is protected by the Golden Shield Project, which is the largest, most complete, most invested and best quality system in the world! </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I agonized, despaired, felt helpless and even thought of succumbing. But if we want to lead a life fit for humans, who can we count on to fight but ourselves? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Man proposes and God disposes. Yet even if I failed, I would hold myself to blame and deserve the life of a dog if I did not struggle for my own ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To struggle for something just in itself adds happiness to one's life, at least in terms of one's self-judgment in one's own heart. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, I have absolutely no need to worry about the future of China, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the global environment is already such that it will not permit the existence of a regime that has failed to hold elections for so long. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is merely a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I just sigh that the Chinese nation could have been so lucky that, at every turn of history, it could always be led by world-class demons onto a marrow-and-blood-sucking road to hell. Some people actually call the heaps of white bones and pools of blood on this road glory and force us to feel proud of such glory. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Although darkness exists everywhere, it is at its longest in China. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Qin Shi Huang and Confucius caused the people to suffer so much. </seg>
<seg id="18"> While Qin Shi Huang persecuted openly, Confucius brainwashed under the table. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It's not that the Chinese do not deserve democracy. It's that they no longer have democracy in their genes, which have all degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A country with a history of over 3,000 years would have become democratic long ago if its national culture had a component for democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> What were the Chinese doing when Athens established its democratic system, when Rome founded the republic, when the British adopted their Charter, when the French issued the Declaration of Human Rights and when the Americans published the Declaration of Independence? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before Mongolians invaded the Central Plains, they elected their monarch through the Kuraltai. In their early days, Manchurians practiced a democratic system of ministerial meetings. Why did all these fizzle out in the Han regions? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Chinese chase material goods and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual belief and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You don't believe it? If the Chinese were given universal suffrage, they would sell it to you for a single pie. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Five hundred thousand years later, it would need an earthquake for the Chinese to want democracy. So run while you can! </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dalai Lama's Envoys Hold Closed Door Talks with Chinese Officials. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Dalai Lama Stressed he Wants Autonomy, Not Independence, for Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Envoys of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama are in China for closed door talks with Chinese officials. Details have not yet been released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth official meeting since China and the Dalai Lama's exiled government resumed contacts in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But, as in the past, the two sides are meeting behind closed doors. No details have yet been disclosed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reporters say the two sides have held talks on several occasions, but so far there have been no tangible results. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in Northern India, says he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet。 </seg>
<seg id="10"> China has refused to comment on the talks between the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But analysts say Beijing wants dialogue, partly because it fears the death of the 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile could lead to heightened sentiments among Tibetans unhappy with China rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural Identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> The delegation from the Dalai Lama's exiled government is led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari. He was also the lead delegate in earlier talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman for the Tibetan government-in-exile said the round of talks that they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very "intensive and frank" and this has given the Tibetan people hope. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesman said their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis of a negotiated settlement with the Chinese leadership so that the Tibetan people will have the freedom to preserve what is important to them, which is their cultural identity. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Dalai Lama's Envoy Reiterates Tibetan Independence is Not Being Sought </seg>
<seg id="18"> Dalai Lama to Visit Washington This Month </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the run-up to the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama's trip to the US on November 8, his envoy has said that the Tibetan government-in-exile is not seeking Tibet's independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hopes that the Chinese government will truly protect Tibet's unique culture and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is expected that during his visit to the US next week the Dalai Lama will discuss the Tibet issue with President Bush in the hope that Bush will press the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In July of this year, envoys of the Dalai Lama's met with Beijing's officials in Berne for their first direct contact. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "Genuine Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that in recent years talks between the Tibetan government-in-exile and the Chinese authorities has revealed some positive elements. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The envoys of the Dalai Lama found that the leaders in Beijing, particularly the delegates of the CCP's United Front Work Department, are more willing than in the past to listen to their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said the Tibetan government-in-exile and the Chinese government still have several differences of opinion and are still far-apart in their standpoints. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that in the last five years the Tibetan government-in-exile has done its utmost to respond to China's demands in order to create a favorable negotiating environment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In order to create a favorable negotiating environment on the Tibetan issue, China should refrain from blindly pressuring the Dalai Lama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said the Dalai Lama does not seek independence for Tibet and that Tibet is still a part of China, but that the Chinese government must protect Tibet's unique culture and "allow the Tibetan people genuine autonomy". </seg>
<seg id="30"> Furthermore, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that some Chinese people think that once the Dalai Lama has died the Tibet issue will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said that this thinking is extremely dangerous because once the Dalai Lama is dead China will have lost a historic opportunity to solve the Tibet issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that the Chinese government only needs to respond to the Dalai Lama's demands and suggest a final means of resolution, then the Dalai Lama will no longer need to talk at the international level about the Tibet issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> The Key Tools of Democracy: Negotiation and Compromise!(ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I've just read a web friend's posting in "Awe-inspiring Righteousness--Mr. Li Guiren" </seg>
<seg id="4"> His (her) original words were "negotiation and compromise are key tools of democracy. Otherwise, divisions due to differences of opinion result in the failure of democracy!!! It is hoped that idealistic democracy advocates will pay close attention to this point!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> That this prosaic and colorless statement did not attract the interest of any web friends stired a succession of thoughts in my mind and filled me with regret. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I think about China's antiquity. I also think about the past in the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I, who have started very few threads, could not resist using a new thread to respond to the posting by the original net friend. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's first take a look at antiquity in China. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everybody knows that in China, starting with the united centralized rule built by Qin Shi Huang, all subsequent dynasties operated according to this political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although the Han Dynasty temporarily implemented a "dual system"; that is, political system in which feudalism and centralism operated in parallel; it finally ended up employing centralism. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Under the historical conditions of that time, this kind of centralism had facets that were advanced or that promoted productivity and development. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But we should also observe that more than two thousand years of this kind of system resulted in localities that lacked the creativity, initiative and motivation that they should have. Furthermore, it was impossible to tailor-make systems and policies so that they suited local development. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A pyramid-shaped system of political rule also made it so that lower-level officials could only fix their gazes upward and in every regard take orders from their immediate superiors. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because the local county officials were all appointed by the central government, there was no room for coordination or negotiation between them, let alone with the common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the rights of peasants in ancient China were infringed upon, they could only grin and bear it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was only when their most basic rights were threatened, such as by large scale famine, or when their right to life was being deprived due to tyranny or natural calamity, that they would rise in rebellion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In two thousand years, several turbulent peasant uprisings have swept across the entire country: from the unplanned Chen Sheng and Wu Guang Uprising to the preplanned Yellow Turban Rebellion, and then to the Huang Chao Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty and Li Zicheng, who was able to rule as emperor for a month as the result of an uprising. Besides Zhu Yuanzhang, none of the rebellions obtained a truly meaningful victory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty that Zhu Yuanzhang initiated was nothing more than the reincarnation of previous dynasties, with no change in political institutions. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Zhu Yuanzhang, born a commoner and uncultured for the most part, manipulated China's ancient centralized system with a perverse relish, taking it to its extreme limits. The vigor of the Tang Dynasty, characterized by openness, freedom and tolerance, was lost and replaced by a deathly spiritlessness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> All at once, the atmosphere of free speech disappeared from China's vast area. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Human nature was suppressed to the highest degree. </seg>
<seg id="22"> People became timorous, extremely afraid, and unwilling to say too much. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This was the outcome of the only peasant uprising to succeed in two thousand years: in one go it turned the Chinese people into the living dead. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now let's look at Western Europe's medieval period, which has been called the Dark Ages. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a thousand year period that occurred after nomadic peoples destroyed Western Rome and that did not have the slightest connection to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This period was characterized by feudalism; that is, the granting of feudal land titles. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As titles were subdivided into increasingly lower strata, the lords at each lower stratum possessed an increased amount of autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Because they were capable of balancing, restricting and depending on each other both vertically and horizontally, even feudal lords with a few square kilometers of land as well as the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons that came to power possessed the conditions and clout to win from the king the rights that were rightfully theirs, thereby producing a situation where aristocrats and the king sat together to negotiate for their respective benefit, a situation that has never existed in China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> That is, mutual accommodation and concession, and not the use of violent methods to beat down and replace the other party. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In this way, with the drawing up various agreements, power steadily moved down into the hands of aristocrats and commoners. The power of the aristocrats and commoners gradually increased while the king's power progressively decreased. </seg>
<seg id="31"> By the time the Queen of England came along, she only occupied a passive position and did not have any real power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This is how democracy was gradually achieved! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let's take another look back in order to make a comparison. In ancient China, with all power concentrated in the hand of the emperor (with the exception of Li Shimin) and almost no aristocracy, it was almost impossible for peasants to sit with the emperor over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and light-heartedly make mutual compromises and concessions or formulate agreements that satisfied both sides. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under such circumstances, when they were being deprived of their right to life, they had no choice but to adopt violent methods to overthrow the current dynasty in an attempt to supplant it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> This outcome repeated itself again and again, from the high point of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> If we compare European and Chinese history, we discover that there is practically no western country with an ancient period where the contradictions between the rulers and the ruled were as sharp as in China. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There is no western country that experienced an endless succession of peasant uprisings like China did. </seg>
<seg id="38"> When contradictions arose between the royal house and the peasants in the ancient history of western countries, the first thing that aristocrats and commoners thought of when they were making an appeal for their own interests was to reach a solution through negotiation and make mutual concessions in order to gradually obtain greater benefits. Rarely did they employ violent methods. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding this, as we enter the 21st century, we can still see on the Internet that there are some democracy militants who, having inherited the ultra-absolute totalitarian thinking of the Ming Dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and whose bodies have been invaded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution, are incapable as democratic warriors of talking about anything but "overthrow" and "toppling". </seg>
<seg id="41"> But this kind of thinking is the greatest barrier to democracy, because these people do not understand that negotiation and cooperation are the most important means and channel to realizing democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Cao Xiaoming--Rich Cultural Activities in the Countryside: Who Will "Pay the Bill"? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> During this year's Spring Festival, I was fortunate enough to spend the New Year in the countryside visiting some family and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While being caught up in the rich New Year's atmosphere in China's countryside, I also became worried about the lack of interesting cultural activities in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I discovered in a friend's village that in past years the village would set out on its own each Spring Festival to organize the villagers in putting on a local play called "The Galloping Horse Lantern". </seg>
<seg id="6"> The play takes as its subject the characters from the Three Kingdoms. Adults and children can all enact a role in the play. The villagers never tire of watching. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In this way, there are several "Galloping Horse Lantern" performance troupes throughout the county. They perform not only in their own village, but also travel to other villages, with the exchange between villages becoming very lively. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But this year the village did not organize a troupe. </seg>
<seg id="9"> , It seems that it took a lot of money just to buy the costumes for "The Galloping Horse Lantern". In the past, the villagers would each contribute some cash, but now the costumes are tattered to the point that they can no longer be worn. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A house-to-house appeal was made to the villagers to again fork out money, but none was willing. A similar situation has arisen in other villages throughout the county. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Without the "Galloping Horse Lantern", the village has suddenly become cold and cheerless. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The adults have started playing mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The children have also started playing cards. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The villagers all say that this New Year's was dull. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other than setting off firecrackers, everybody just played mahjong and that became the general backdrop of Chinese New Year in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, repeated bans have failed to halt a gambling craze that is showing a tendency to spread. Games involving upwards of ten thousand yuan have become a common occurrence, with the large number of returning migrant workers playing a particularly important role in many games. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this way, money earned from a year of hard work is squandered. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also, family squabbles stemming from gambling sometimes occur. Some even descend into tragedies where families are split or life is lost. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some farmers say that they gamble not only during the Spring Festival, but also often during the slack season. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If they don't gamble, they don't have anywhere to go. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In the countryside, it is too difficult to organize cultural activities or find entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Not only is there a lack of facilities and funds, but also nobody volunteers to handle the organization. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this respect, the method used in Jiangxi is doubtlessly welcome news for rural dwellers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to enrich the cultural life of the rural population, the Jiangxi provincial government has not only implemented as of September last year a program of "government funding, market operation, town construction of stages and villagers watching plays", </seg>
<seg id="25"> but also organizes each year a special fund of at least Rmb60 million for rural cultural projects in order to provide the rural population high quality cultural products. </seg>
<seg id="26"> With the New Year, it added an additional Rmb40 million, making a rural cultural project fund totaling Rmb100 million. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For the rural population, the fruits of this special fund are also very substantial: </seg>
<seg id="28"> They invite various types of professional performance troupes to come to the villages to perform. Each village cannot have less than four performances each year. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They invite screening teams from different levels of movie companies and organizations to come to the villages to show movies. Each administrative village cannot have less than six screenings of entertainment and educational films each year. </seg>
<seg id="30"> They organize and hold popular cultural events that have local character. Each village cannot have less than two or three each year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> From this "purchase list", we can easily see that the government has not thrown money at the problem, but rather has expended a lot of energy to use limited funds in an incisive way in order to deliver a cultural feast with good value to the vast rural population. They have performed an important task. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now, not an individual among the vast rural population is not ecstatic about the waiver of the grain tax. </seg>
<seg id="33"> If governments could do like Jiangxi and make greater "purchases" to enrich the cultural life of the rural population, it would be another gift from heaven for those living in the countryside, </seg>
<seg id="34"> and this "gift" would not only free the farmers from the mahjong table, the movement in cultural activities would also add another brick in socialist construction of a new countryside. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Kidnap Warning for Wang Peirong's Child Was a False Alarm </seg>
<seg id="4"> After nine o'clock on the evening of January 24, 2006, the child of Wang Peirong finished relating the following: </seg>
<seg id="5"> While making up classes in physics at Xuzhou's No. 3 Middle School on the morning of January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The entrance guard informed Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men had said the following to the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School:  Wang Peirong's child, Wang Tianjiao, has not returned home for three days because the father and mother of Wang Peirong's child are not getting along. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now her mother is missing. We are leaders from her mother's work unit and want to enter No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Peirong's child told the entrance guards that what the three men had said was completely untrue and she refused to go with the three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With the help of the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School, Wang Peirong's child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child phoned her mother's leader at noon to find out what was going on. The leader denied sending anybody to Xuzhou's No. 3 middle school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Wang Peirong's child asked her for the phone number of her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Wang Peirong's child said: Three people came to No. 3 Middle School to take me away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The leader asked: Why didn't you go with them? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Wang Peirong's child answered: If I had gone with them I would be dead for sure. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When she had finished speaking, Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hearing a description of the events from his child, Wang Peirong felt that the situation was serious and reported it to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On January 25, the local police station received feedback that the story told by Wang Peirong's child was essentially true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The police station asked the Kuangda Security Department if they had sent people to the No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong's child. They responded that they hadn't. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The police station again asked the Kuangda Security Department if any of its branch units had sent people to No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong's child. They again answered that they hadn't. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Through them, the relevant departments warned Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Following the event, the leaders of the relevant departments of Xuzhou municipality paid close attention. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau excluded the possibility of a kidnap attempt against the child. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked the relevant department heads of the Xuzhou municipality and the criminal investigation department of Xuzhou Public Security Department. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It was a false alarm. The main cause of the false alarm was possibly the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau has learned: On January 24, the leader of the College of Science, which is Wang Peirong's work unit, and three other individuals urgently needed to find Wang Peirong (Wang Peirong still does not know why they were looking for him) and could not find him  by telephone. They thought of going to No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong's child in order to ask if Wang Peirong's child was still in Xuzhou. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A weighty topic: Why is the risk involved in corruption relatively low while the cost of fighting corruption is high? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> Under the present cadre system and anti-corruption system, what corrupt officials need to be worry about is a few relevant officials overseeing them, not the broad masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, once they feel that they have successfully hoodwinked or contented those few officials that can determine their fate, they can they feel reassured and unafraid as they carry out their great project of corruptly and illegally collecting wealth while disregarding the feelings of the nearby masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="31"> On the contrary, if the common people who don't hold any power come across an injustice and stand up against corruption, they will possibly provoke an extremely brutal reprisal, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or be branded by the government and end up at any time being crushed in defeat before obtaining any victory. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A comparison of the two: engaging in corruption is relatively risk free, while the cost of resisting corruption on the other hand is high. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now let's take a look at the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency verified on the 6th that the Iranian government had sent a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency demanding that it dismantle and remove all equipment monitoring Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Because the International Atomic Energy Agency decided to report the Iran nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council, Iran has announced the termination of all support and cooperation measures it had adopted with respect to the nuclear issue, and it will not longer permit the International Atomic Energy Agency to perform surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Targeting the current tense situation with respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said on the 6th in Athens that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will become the driving force in the resolution of the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On the same day, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Russia's proposal to Iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within Russia's borders was still effective. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two parties could engage in negotiations concerning this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the same day, at United Nations headquarters in New York, Senator Lugar, chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the United States does not approve of Israeli attacks of Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> According to recent reports, Israeli defense experts have said that, if necessary, Israel could severely damage Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xinhua News Agency reports that on the 7th, Russian deputy foreign minister Kislyak said Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran regarding the nuclear issue and help Iran obtain the legal authority to peacefully develop nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kislyak said that Russia's proposal to Iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to hold negotiations with Iran concerning this issue in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13"> At the end of December last year, Russia submitted a proposal to Iran that the two countries establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within Russia's borders. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The European Union and the United States both said that they could accept this compromise proposal. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But Iran hopes Russia will continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the 7th, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Kong Quan said that although the International Atomic Energy Agency had reported the Iran atomic energy problem to the United Nations Security Council, it had not transferred the agency's responsibility to handle the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, the various parties must still break the deadlock over the Iran nuclear issue within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. </seg>
<seg id="18"> According to a resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency, International Atomic Energy Agency General Director Baradei will deliver a report concerning the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> After evaluating this report, the Security Council will make a final decision. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We feel that this resolution mentions requiring Iran to, uh, fulfill the relevant Security Council resolutions and the promises it has made, and has not submitted or transferred this problem to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> For some time recently, China has sought a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic means. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, Director-General of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of Arms Control and Disarmament, held talks in Tehran concerning the Iran nuclear issue with Lalijiani, negotiating representative of the Secretariat of the Supreme Security Council of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Chinese hope Iran will attach importance to the international community as the key to creating conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue within the IAEA framework is not only in China's interests; moreover, we firmly believe that it is in the interests of all parties. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To this end, we once again call on the concerned parties in the international community to not abandon the diplomatic efforts made regarding this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is currently in the process of forming the new Palestinian self-rule government, has announced that, with the exception of the prime minister, the nominees for the new government's cabinet are essentially in place. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This has triggered all manner of speculation among outsiders concerning the selection of the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the 8th, a senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press that Hamas was prepared to nominate ((businessman)) Khudari, chairman of the board of trustees of Islamic University in Gaza, but this nomination has yet to be formally submitted to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With the support of Hamas, Khudari, who is now 51, participated in Palestine's parliamentary election last month as an independent candidate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Khudari has never mentioned violence or opposition to Israel in his public speeches. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But he has said that Palestine must engage in internal reform. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A high-level Hamas delegation is currently visiting Cairo to discuss the issue of Hamas' formation of the new Palestinian Authority government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the 8th, Khaled Masha'al, a member of the delegation, told the press that despite the constant pressure from the international community and certain Arab countries, the Palestinian government formed by Hamas leaders would not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, Masha'al warned Abbas in his statement: do not arbitrarily change the structure of Palestinian leadership without consulting Hamas in advance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts believe that this was in response to Abbas' plan to appoint interior minister Yousef as deputy commander of security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And concerning the issue of the formation of a new Palestinian self-rule government, Masha'al declined to verify the news that Hamas was preparing to nominate ((businessman)) Khudari, chairman of the board of trustees of Islamic University in Gaza to serve as the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Masha'al said, "The nominee for prime minister has yet to be determined." </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to Masha'al's reiteration of the refusal to recognize Israel, in an Egyptian television interview, Ma'erzuke, another Hamas political leader, said, "Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legal status of Israel, but the new government will continue have contacts with Israel in a variety of areas. Because whether or not one recognizes Israel and whether or not one has dealings with it are two different matters." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Setting aside the new animosity and old grudges toward Israel of the three Hamas nominees for prime minister, territorial issues have always been a sticking point in Palestinian-Israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In an interview with Israeli television channel 2 on the 7th, Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister of Israel, said that Israel must be separated from Palestine through the delineation of a permanent border. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This implies that Israel will have no choice but to withdraw from some of the territory on the west bank of the Jordan River. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control large Jewish settlements on the west bank of the Jordan and the Jordan River Valley area, and will preserve the integrity of Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="24"> Assistant Minister of Commerce Chen Jian said that if safe operations could not be guaranteed for the time being, work could not begin on the cement factory construction project. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Only when the safety of construction personnel could be guaranteed would work continue. </seg>
<seg id="26"> After the ((emergency response)) team was established, we immediately, uh, instructed people at the front to rush to the front lines where the incident occurred to investigate and study the local situation. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The bodies of the three Chinese engineers killed near Karachi on the 15th began their journey back to China from Karachi's Faisal air force base on the morning of the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The atmosphere at Karachi's Faisal air force base in the first rays of the morning sun was very solemn. </seg>
<seg id="5"> China's ambassador to Pakistan, Zhang Chunxiang, the director of the internal affairs department of Sind province, where Karachi is located, and China's consul general to Pakistan, Sun Chunye, led Chinese consular personnel in Pakistan and employees from Chinese companies to give their departed compatriots a final sendoff. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The plane took off from the air field at around 7:20 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This plane will make a brief stop in the Pakistan capital of Islamabad. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Hello Li Guangyu, give us a report on the situation at your end. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Greetings, anchor. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We remain unclear as to the specific time that the plane from there will land at the airport here. </seg>

<seg id="22"> Uh, now, their work unit, uh, in the last two days, the chairman of the labor union of the cement institute over here, uh, has established a consolation team, which has continually been doing consolation work in the homes of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="23"> As for the specific compensation figure, we still have no definite, certain answer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Uh, we do know that one of the insurance items is 400,000 in accidental injury insurance. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Uh, the families have yet to contact insurance companies directly concerning claims; rather, the work unit has stepped forward to make inquiries with the claims processing company and the, uh, insurance company concerning the processing of claims. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Uh, this is the situation as I understand it at present. </seg>
<seg id="27"> All right, thank you, Li Guangyu, for your onsite report. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Additionally, Yuan Fengning, Xue Jijun and Yang Wei, who were fortunate to survive the terrorist attack on February 15, and other personnel from the Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute who were stationed in Balochistan, Pakistan, returned by plane to Hefei. </seg>
<seg id="29"> When the plane carrying the three survivors and the eleven other employees arrived in Hefei, the people waiting at the airport breathed a sigh of relief. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I feel that being able to return safely, I feel very relieved. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And our country is very (()) to attach importance to this matter. </seg>
<seg id="32"> After the incident occurred, the appropriate relocation of them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Now they are  to be delivered safely home. </seg>

<seg id="39"> Just one hour ago, at twelve o'clock Beijing time, Pakistani police met with Chinese consular staff in Pakistan and reported the progress of the investigation to the Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Now let's connect with our correspondent in Pakistan, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Hello, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hey, hello. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In the meeting just now, through-- </seg>
<seg id="45"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="46"> In the information meeting just now, what progress in the investigation was reported? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Ah, all right. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Just as you've said, only an hour ago, the chief of police in Balochistan, the province where the place where the incident occurred is located, by the name of Yakubu, came to China's consulate general in Karachi to report on the investigation into this affair by Pakistani police in the last two days to China's ambassador and consul general. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In his report, he briefly introduced the current clues and objectives of the, uh, Pakistani police in pursuing the primary culprits. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Uh, they firmly believe that this matter was done by outsiders, but they are certain that they had contacts with some local residents. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So, they are now focusing on, uh, uh, certain employees who had employment relationships with the company where the Chinese engineers worked. </seg>
<seg id="52"> They believe these people could have provided, uh, some clues, provided some intelligence for the culprits, intelligence including, for example, what time the Chinese engineers departed and what time they arrived in what places. </seg>
<seg id="53"> They may have also provided cover for these culprits. </seg>
<seg id="54"> So these, uh, aspects are the focus of the current police investigation. </seg>
<seg id="55"> According to this chief of police, he said that after two days of investigations, they had interrogated over fifty people. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The scope of this investigation is currently shrinking. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Also, um, when the Chinese information meeting ended, this chief of police and his police officers also, also went into the mourning hall set up in the Karachi consulate general to pay their respects to the, uh, three deceased. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Uh, additionally, um, another thing that was relatively interesting was that a Balochistan Liberation Army that had always claimed to exist in the past (()) responsibility for this matter, but this news has yet to be verified by Pakistani officials. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Uh, when answering the questions of this station's reporter concerning this matter, that chief of police said that this, uh, terrorist organization in fact is a very loose terrorist group with no definite integral organization. </seg>
<seg id="60"> So, uh, he many many people claim to be members of this organization. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Uh, therefore, uh, from the Pakistani perspective, they, uh, are still laying the focus of the investigation on many specific individuals. </seg>
<seg id="62"> As for this organization, they do not view it as a major key, uh, uh, aspect. </seg>
<seg id="63"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="64"> All right, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="65"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="66"> Mm, we will continue to keep an eye on the related investigation situation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Danish prime minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2"> He said, "The incident of the cartoons of Islam founder Mohammed has developed to the current state where extremists are exploiting it." </seg>
<seg id="3"> He ((claimed)) that Denmark respects all beliefs, and he appealed that everyone has the same rights, uh, while also calling on Muslims to exercise restraint and not resort to violence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Danish prime minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference in the Prime Minister's Office at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Rasmussen said. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The incidents of violence that have occurred at the embassies of these European countries are not merely a matter between Muslim countries and Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is extremely important to the Danish government and the Danish people to obtain the broad support of the international community to pass through this difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We have formed an alliance with France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some organizations and institutions in Muslim countries belonging to other European countries and the United States are cooperating closely. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Several minutes ago, U.S. president Bush telephoned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> During the telephone conversation, he expressed support for Denmark and consensus with Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Rasmussen said, "We also feel that the matter will be resolved through dialogue and tolerance, not violence." </seg>
<seg id="13"> We emphasize that freedom and democracy and respect for beliefs are treasured values. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today we call on the people in all Muslim countries to cooperate to end the expansion of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We must resolve the matter through dialogue, not violence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Today we are facing an expanded international situation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We have seen the burning of the Danish flag and the destruction of its embassies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We see Danish people being seen as intolerant people, being seen as enemies of Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Extremists and radicals are exploiting cultural conflict to expand the situation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Rasmussen emphasized, "Denmark and we Danes are not the enemies of Islam or other religions." </seg>
<seg id="22"> For many generations has Denmark transcended politics in pursuit of human rights, democracy and freedom. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We continue to struggle for this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This is part of Denmark's history, and is an essential component of Danish society. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="26"> We respect all beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> We resist violence. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We believe that everyone has equal rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> New Tang Dynasty reporters Li Luo and Dan Ni, reporting from Copenhagen, Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Iranian extremists dissatisfied with the publication of cartoons of Mohammed once again charged the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday, lobbing Molotov cocktails at it. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, in revenge, a state newspaper in Iran sponsored a contest of cartoons depicting the Nazi slaughter of Jews. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The United States condemned this move as an arrogant means of intensifying Iranian president Ahmadinejad's persistent anti-Israeli sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Approximately 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the wall into the courtyard of Denmark's embassy in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And more than 300 people outside the embassy threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the building. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The previous day, student members of an Iranian hardline paramilitary organization led hundreds of protesters in an attack on the embassies of Denmark and Austria in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The cartoons that triggered the dispute were first published last September by Denmark's Jyllands-Posten. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Other European countries and three Arabic newspapers also carried them subsequently. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In retaliation, Hamshahri, Iran's most widely distributed newspaper, recently announced that it was sponsoring a contest of cartoons depicting the Nazi slaughter of the Jews. </seg>
<seg id="39"> This move was sharply denounced by the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="40"> United States Department of State spokesperson McCormack said that this move by Iran's best-selling Hamshahri was in order to strengthen the virulent anti-Israeli sentiment espoused by president Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated that the United States supports freedom of speech everywhere throughout the world, including Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he believes that Hamshahri's cartoon contest and the cartoons of Mohammed published in the Danish media are two entirely separate matters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said, "I do not believe anyone would mention freedom of the press in Iran and freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States in the same breath." </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad once said that the slaughter of the Jews was a fiction, and called for Israel to be wiped off the map, attracting broad criticism from the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="45"> McCormack believes that Hamshahri is owned and published by the conservative municipal government of Tehran. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Since attorney Gao Zhisheng initiated a synchronous 24 hour hunger strike in ten cities nationwide to oppose Chinese Communist oppression, and 170 Shanghai appellants have collectively signed a petition expressing their willingness to participate in this hunger strike activity to defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="2"> They also said they would continue to announce the signatures and number of participants in the second batch. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Please watch the following report filed by this station. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to reports, as the result of intentional profiteering activities on the part of the government, Shanghai housing prices are now ranked among the highest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Many government units have come up with ways to force demolition and relocation of residents in residential housing in highly priced areas without offering reasonable compensation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> These people, who have suffered the painful loss of their homes under forced demolition and removal, have been left immediately with no income to rely on. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Children unable to pay tuition dare not attend school. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For many years, the vast majority of people who have appealed such matters have been rewarded with time in labor reeducation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> According to statistical data, Shanghai is the region with the largest number of people petitioning for assistance in China. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Han Zhongming originally owned a shop, but when faced with forced demolition and removal, his private residence was also resold at an exorbitant price. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Because he petitioned to higher authorities for assistance, authorities placed him under house arrest and even detained him. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He jumped from a building and cut his wrists in protest, and was only released recently. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Chen Enjuan's store also met with government peremptory demolition and removal. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The government hired thugs to drag her and her other two family members outside, then a tractor shovel was used to eradicate her house, furniture and all. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because she appealed for help, she underwent nearly two years of labor reeducation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Chen Enjuan spoke of this solidarity hunger strike activity, in addition to protesting the government's thug-like conduct. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Attorney Gao has offered us much assistance with respect to legal matters, he has helped us very selflessly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Our defense of our rights now is a demand for democracy, ah, because we are considering the next generation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The generation that preceded us already suffered enough; we are fighting so that the next generation will not be oppressed. Therefore, we must participate in that rights defense activity. We cannot abandon it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> According to a report by the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions, a human rights organization in Geneva, China has been listed among the countries with the most serious violations of housing rights in the world. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reported by New Tang Dynasty reporter Wang Xin and special assignment reporter Gu Qing'er. </seg>
<seg id="22"> With respect to the new round of rights defense hunger strike activities initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng, on February 15, many democracy activists and ordinary citizens in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Calgary, Canada and the greater Philadelphia region in the United States expressed their support and solidarity through a variety of means. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The following is a comprehensive report filed by this station's reporters. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The 24-hour hunger strike activity initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng in ten provinces and cities throughout China beginning February 14 is in protest of the tyrannical rule of the Chinese Communists. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Legislative Councilor Leung Kwok-hung, who has expressed support for attorney Gao Zhisheng's hunger strike movement, said that the Chinese Communists' unrestrained arrest of defenders of rights in recent days is already an extremely dangerous signal that this regime has absolutely no basis in popular will. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That same day was the time of the one-day weekly hunger strike by Legislative Councilor Albert Ho, who is in the process of setting up a human rights defender watch group. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that on this day this week, he would introduce the work of a human rights defense lawyer from inside China to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He was also certain that such human rights defense movements would continue. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On February 13 in Calgary, Canada, employees of the Epoch Times and Falungong practitioners held a joint press conference outside the Chinese consulate, expressing support for the domestic and foreign relay hunger strike initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng, and opposing the acts of violence against American Falungong practitioner Li Yuan by Chinese Communist agents, and called on the government of Canada and all just-minded people inside and outside China to watch with concern and support human rights defense activities in China. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This is Warner Village Square, a busy shopping district in Taipei. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The global relay hunger strike against oppression initiated by the Epoch Times has entered its second day. </seg>
<seg id="32"> People from all walks of life in Taiwan have rushed to participate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Legislator Tien Chiu-chin also arrived on the scene to join the ranks of the hunger strikers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tien Chiu-chin will fast 24 hours today as a show of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "People in the peaceful, more democractic, more free world should all support this event." </seg>
<seg id="36"> She said. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Five non-governmental social groups, including the Taiwan South Society and the Kaohsiung Medical Professional Association, said that all of Taiwan should speak out in condemnation of the Chinese Communists' tendency to use violence to handle defenders of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Yang Wei-che, professor of the Department of Mathematics at National Taiwan University, said, </seg>
<seg id="39"> "This is extremely important. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This can absolutely create a force. </seg>
<seg id="41"> That monster, its maliciousness, that violence would be very difficult to put down." </seg>
<seg id="42"> Over 40 people concerned about Chinese democracy and liberty came from Delaware, Philadelphia, South Jersey and New York to participate in the global human rights defense relay hunger strike press conference in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, condemning the armed Chinese Communist agents who beat up Epoch Times Chief Technology Officer Li Yuan in broad daylight, and expressing solidarity with the act of justice initiated by Gao Zhisheng in China. </seg>
<seg id="43"> On that day, 14 Chinese participated in the global human rights defense relay hunger strike for 24 hours. </seg>

<seg id="1"> India's Sashastra Seema Bal strengthened Nepal border patrols on February 17. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Due to concerns that the Maoist insurrections that have taken place in increasing number and intensity over the last several months could penetrate the border, three new battalions have been added to Sashastra Seema Bal, which is responsible for guarding the 200-kilometer India-Nepal border in Darjeeling County. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nepal faces the Himalaya mountains to the north. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On its other three sides, it borders on India, with which it shares a border totaling 1,477 kilometers in length. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maoist rebels frequently sneak into Indian border villages and obtain weapons from local gangs and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Deputy inspector general Shanaya of the Lanidanjia region indicated that they would be increasing from the existing 26 battalions to 36 battalions to facilitate patrols of the 100-kilometer border between Darjeeling County and West Sikkim. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Shanaya indicated that according to reports, India's Kamtapur Liberation Organization and Maoist rebels in Jhapa and Ilam counties in eastern Nepal already have close ties. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Border forces will establish 18 border observation stations and further strengthen border security. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Trained police dogs will accompany border forces on patrols to detect explosives and drugs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Border officials have begun thorough inspections of all vehicles and people passing through sensitive border inspection stations. </seg>

<seg id="14"> Japan's Cabinet Office published gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter of 2005 on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="15"> After price adjustments, in the quarter from October through December, experienced real growth of 1.4 percent over the previous quarter; the growth rate exceeded the anticipated rate of 17.2 percent. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The primary reasons were strong domestic demand and signs of continuing economic recovery exhibited by export growth to major countries such as China and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is Japan's fourth consecutive quarter exhibiting economic growth, and is the greatest rate since the first through third quarters of 2005, primarily aided by personal spending, capital expenditures and stable exports. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Additionally, in April, Japan's central bank will also end its extremely lax monetary policy of the last five years. This has encouraged financial market expectations for the economy. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Private sector consumption from October through December rose 0.8% percent under the effects of slight improvements in the unemployment rate and wages. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Nikkei index rose after the announcement of the gross domestic product data, but by the end of the morning session, it had fallen 0.74 points. </seg>
<seg id="21"> After appreciating briefly, the yen fell, with trading prices hovering at around 118.15 yen to one U.S. dollar. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Immediately following the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to hand the Iran nuclear issue over to the United Nations Security Council, Iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiations with the United States, one of the proponents. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Uh, an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the United States implemented to date has been not to discuss or negotiate its relationship with the opposing party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said that it was a major mistake for the west to hand the nuclear issue over to the Security Council, demonstrating the west's obstruction of Iran's development. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On Sunday, Iran said that it was suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and would resume uranium extraction and enrichment and prohibit surprise inspections of nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> So with respect to this issue, Iran's current attitude is relatively unyielding, and the attitude of the United States is even more unyielding. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Uh, American secretary of defense Rumsfeld has already reasserted multiple times that the use of military force has not been ruled out with respect to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, now it is rumored that the U.S. military is really in the process of implementing such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are developing a kind of superhuge bomb called the mother of bombs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Uh, once the Defense Department orders it, they will use this superhuge, uh, bomb to bomb Iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So how big a bomb is this mother of bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to reports, just in terms of weight, it is 30,000 pounds, equivalent to a double decker bus, and, uh, it is also extremely large in volume. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Uh, the development of such a super bomb is primarily in order to bomb certain, uh, underground facilities in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Because of its extremely strong penetration force--it can pass through concrete as well as steel plates--it is likely to create a large pit equivalent to 60 meters long half a mile, destroying many such, uh, underground structures and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So now it appears that the United States has truly begun provisionally polishing its guns or provisionally making bombs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Regarding this issue, Rumsfeld says that no means have been ruled out to resolve the Iran nuclear issue, and military means had already been placed on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Also, the Iran nuclear issue is continually upgrading, so, uh, when interviewed by this station, a concerned Iranian official stationed in Washington said that in fact, Iran continued to uphold the adoption of peaceful negotiations to cooperate with international society, and, uh, they hoped to alleviate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But he also said that Iran would adjust the contents of its nuclear project in cooperation with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Regarding the second round of negotiations between Iran and Russia concerning the uranium enrichment project, Iran said that the negotiations would proceed as originally planned, but it emphasized that the changes occurring in the current situation made it necessary to make some adjustments to the content of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Previously, Russia had always expressed support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear power, and it had expressed that it would insist on not submitting the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, now we see that they have already approved the submission of the Iran nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With this new situation, we therefore may make some changes to the policies arrived at previously with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And, prior to the U.N. Security Council's final decision as to whether or not to adopt economic and political sanctions in March, Iran has advocated continuous negotiations with international agencies, and it is willing to cooperate with the international community, thereby alleviating the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We emphasize, in order to fight for our own economic development and national construction, Iran will not relinquish the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated relevant international laws. We hope that the United States can also understand this. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the problems in Afghanistan and Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the United States is also very clear on this point. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As for so-called military attacks, we have not seen any clear statement of position from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We do not wish to see the crisis escalate further. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We also emphasize that we want to use peaceful negotiating methods, but we will not submit to pressure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Additionally, ((Agabi)) also said that he hoped China continue to maintain cooperation with China based on the preservation of its original stance. </seg>

<seg id="1"> First, let's look at today's headlines. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The northeastern states and Atlantic coast region of the United States were blasted by the first blizzard of the winter this morning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Accumulations exceeded 60 centimeters in some areas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Many airports were forced to shut down. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Over 2,000 flights were canceled. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And this was the first snowfall of this magnitude in New York City's history. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, this was the second highest snowfall record in history. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's have a look at the specifics. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On Sunday morning, New York residents woke up to find themselves in a world of white. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Most buildings and streets outside were covered in a thick layer of accumulated snow. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New York's Central Park recorded a snowfall of 57.9 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This is the second highest snowfall record in New York City's history. </seg>
<seg id="13"> New York's Mayor Bloomberg said this was a frightening blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For the sake of safety, he urged people to stay at home and not go out. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The storm forced the cancellation of most flights at New York City's three airports. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Some of them were only be able to resume on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The snow flew in Washington as well, where snowfall exceeded 50 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Lawns and tree trunks were enrobed in white. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But President Bush still went to church, as is his custom. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Many city residents left their homes to appreciate the wintry landscape and took the opportunity to play in the snow. </seg>
<seg id="21"> United States Weather Service radars showed snowfalls occurring universally from eastern Virginia all the way up to Maine. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In New Jersey, New York's Long Island, Connecticut and Maryland, residential and commercial electricity was also interrupted after the blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was estimated that over 150,000 customers were without power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Meanwhile, in Europe, a broad area was also affected by snowstorms. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The southern German state of Bavaria mobilized several thousand firefighters and soldiers, who, together with police and volunteers, cleaned accumulated snow from rooftops and roads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Deggendorf area in eastern Bavaria remained in a state of emergency after several days of major snowfall. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Some villages had already lost contact with the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Pressure from accumulated snow caused a roof to cave in last month in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, resulting in 15 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Phoenix Satellite News Roundup. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the blizzard that blasted the northeastern United States, New York was of course one of the cities affected. </seg>
<seg id="31"> For the local situation, we are about to connect to this station's New York correspondent, Luo Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hello, Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hello, Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Hey. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Experiencing such a large snowstorm here, what exactly is the situation like? </seg>
<seg id="36"> We've heard that there are even power outages in some areas, is it true? </seg>
<seg id="37"> And what places have been affected? </seg>
<seg id="38"> It's really true. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In fact, the, uh, area covered by this blizzard is quite broad. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Then I am very happy to report, we have finally seen the snow stop. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although this blizzard came on ferociously, there have been no reports of major casualties. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Several states in the eastern United States coverage area have been affected, such as Maryland, with 21 inches of accumulation, Pennsylvania with 19 inches, and New York and New Jersey with accumulations in excess of 24 inches. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Snowflakes could be seen from Virginia to Maine, and even in Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Then, well, uh, as you just said, uh, it resulted in power outages in many areas in the Washington area and Baltimore. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The total number of households without power is probably over 100,000. </seg>
<seg id="46"> New York City is better off, as to power outages in, uh, New York City's Manhattan, the power supply situation is normal. Only in Long Island are there some outages. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Only emergency vehicles such as snowplows and ambulances are permitted to pass on roads. </seg>
<seg id="49"> As to traffic and transportation, a little while ago, uh, the three major airports in the New York area were closed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But, uh, as twilight approached, we discovered that, like, certain activities to resume airport operations had begun appearing at Newark Airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia Airport in New York. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So some people estimate that these airports will open later, uh, in several hours. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Like Delta Airlines, Delta Airlines has announced that all flights in Washington, as well as Philadelphia, Baltimore and Connecticut have been grounded until Monday. </seg>
<seg id="53"> At present, Reagan Airport in Washington, DC is already open. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At present, buses have suspended operation in the New York and New Jersey region. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And scheduled bus and train service has been reduced. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Now we are at, uh, it is currently Sunday in New York, still the Lantern Festival. </seg>
<seg id="57"> To us Chinese, the Lantern Festival, originally, some local Chinese communities had Lantern Festival activities, but they were forced to cancel them. </seg>
<seg id="58"> As to the people of New York, generally speaking, their Sunday activities were also canceled. Uh, not many people are going out, they are all staying at home. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What's troubling everyone now is what to do about work on Monday? </seg>
<seg id="61"> Uh, snow removal and, uh, accumulated snow could result in some flooding. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Therefore, the governments of these, uh, affected areas in the United States are studying how to face the floods of people and cars going to work on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="64"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Thank you, Xiaoying, for giving us the latest report from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Since there's nothing to be done about it, one might as well rest easy and appreciate this, uh, very beautiful snowscape. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's have a look at several news items concerning Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan's Defense Agency to a ministry, in order to increase Japan's military strength. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But great controversy has been stirred up during this process, which has met with one snag after another. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, scandals have arisen when Japan's Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which is subordinate to the Defense Agency, placed requests for bids, uh, requests for construction bids, resulting in arrests by authorities of certain current and former officials. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, many people have recommended that Koizumi exercise caution in the process of upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, recently, Koizumi said that he was temporarily shelving this plan, that for the time being he would not be submitting it to the Diet for deliberation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, he also hopes that the two ruling parites are able to discuss this issue carefully in order to, er, continue exchanging views. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In other news, if you go to Japan, there is now a new requirement. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Japan plans to require the majority of tourists and travelers visiting Japan to be fingerprinted and photographed. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is doing so in order to prevent certain unsafe elements from entering Japan. It is also intended to prevent, uh, illegal immigration. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, so now, it should be a little more difficult to go to Japan. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, of course, Japan also had a bit of happy news recently. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Princess Kiko of Japan is expecting. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This matter has made many Japanese naturally hope that she will bear a son to succeed to the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, she has also made waves in the imperial household, which has always been relatively calm. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Uh, in fact, Kiko of course is now a later-age expectant mother, and everyone always thought she was satisfied with her family of four. </seg>
<seg id="17"> With her becoming pregnant again at this age, many people could not help but guess that, uh, a struggle for the throne could be playing out between the brothers of the royal family. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, many people are delighted to talk about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To explain this matter may require going back several years. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Uh, it was like this: at the time, in '02, because Crown Prince Naruhito, uh, his wife, became depressed, the royal family did not hold out much hope for them at the time, so they turned to exerting pressure on Prince Akishino. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At that time, there was not much response from Akishino. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But by 2004, the contradiction intensified somewhat, because Naruhito, eager to protect his wife, blamed the royal family in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, according to reports, the royal family was infuriated, and demanded that Prince Akishino, who is of the same generation, step forward to make a rebuttal, saying that his elder brother had been disrespectful to the royal family, and was doting on his wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From then on, there has been discord between the brothers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So now, if, uh, Prince Akishino bears a son, then their, uh, main axis will become a pillar of the, uh, royal family. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And that will assuredly cause a decline of the eastern palace, that is, the crown prince. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Uh, so a good many people believe that if this happens, it will have a great impact on the royal family and Japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="1"> United Nations Secretary General Annan went to the White House Monday to meet with American president Bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Regarding Iran's announced postponement of nuclear negotiations with Russia, Annan urged Iran to cease nuclear activities as quickly as possible, and to resolve problems through negotiations rather than confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Another news item indicates that the U.S. Department of Defense has already begun plans for intensive bombing of Iran, to serve as the ultimate backup plan if diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, outsiders thought that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, but the two did not announce discussions in this regard after their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Bush and Annan both emphasized that they hoped the Iranian nuclear issue would be resolved through negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed concerns over Iran's commencement of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the U.S. media reported that military strategists at the Pentagon had already begun intensive planning of military actions to be adopted with respect to Iran; in the event that diplomatic efforts fail, the U.S. will use military means to halt Iran's development of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to reports, the commander of the U.S. Central Command is in the process of determining attack targets. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Attack methods could include submarine-launched ballistic missles and air strikes by B-2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On Monday, Annan called on all parties not to adopt actions that would escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to analysis by military experts, Iran could have the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And there are still more than two years remaining in Bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will strive to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term, whether by peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Mo Naiqian, Phoenix Satellite News, reporting from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the 13th, Iranian president Ahmadinejad said superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons were about to disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> While commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that the arms contests and competitions in the scramble for hegemony among various countries in the world would not yield results. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The appetites of superpowers can never be satisfied. They even threaten other countries with their weapons. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But he said these superpowers who rely on weapons to threaten other countries would disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind enjoys permanent peace and stability is about to arrive. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus it can be seen that this is now not merely, um, a war of words, but really and truly, um, this kind of saber rattling between Iran and the western world and America is now getting worse and worse. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So, because the, uh, attitudes between Iraq and the United States are mutually unyielding, recently, the situation has changed somewhat; the day before yesterday, Iran formally announced that it was resuming its plans to extract and enrich uranium. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some western diplomats surmised that they may very well have actually resumed certain processes in uranium extraction and enrichment prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Additionally, Iran announced that it was postponing negotiations with Russia indefinitely; the negotiations concerned Russia extracting and enriching uranium instead of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So of course the indefinite postponement of this negotiation plan was also determined with respect to the current, new situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Uh, recently, because the United States, uh, has continued its threats to attack Iran, a U.K. think tank, the Oxford Institute, has issued a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the United States actually adopts military force, it will result in the death of half of the people, and of course it will trigger, uh, the possible continuation of this year's, uh, wave of violence in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Also, some, uh, terrorist attacks will also worsen. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, oil prices will also rise sharply. This is also among the, uh, this series of domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Moreover, the report also says that if the United States is unable to make Iran submit, it will certainly accelerate Iran's determination to produce nuclear weapons itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So, we have just mentioned the issue of negotiations between Russia and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="32"> An Iranian government spokesperson indeed indicated on Monday that due to the emergence of the new situation, the negotiations with Russian officials concerning the extraction and enrichment of uranium inside Russia originally set for the 16th would be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that they had not received formal notification from Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So it is currently still too early to say whether the meeting will go on. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Additionally, on Monday, uh, the head of Russia's Federal International Atomic Energy Agency, Guqinuofu, said that the Russians had already prepared the conditions and principles for negotiations with Iran concerning the nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> At the same time, the New York Times of the United States recently published an editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2"> And the title of this editorial was extremely striking: Japan's offensive foreign minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> So, this editorial, uh, specifically mentions that Taro Aso, the Japanese foreign minister, has made a series of astonishing statements recently. </seg>
<seg id="4"> These statements are all extremely dishonest, extremely unwise, and these statements have been met with the universal indignation of Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, uh, the editorial also specifically mentions that Japan, uh, should acknowledge its own mistakes and assimilate lessons, unlike what it is doing now--post-war educational materials avoiding mention of the things they did during the war. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, this editorial also says that many of Taro Aso's current statements, such as demanding that the, uh, prime minister visit the Yasukuni Shrine, such as, uh, colonial rule over Taiwan raised, ah, uh, Japan's colonial rule raised the education level of Taiwan, etc.--it astonishes people when he makes such statements, and, very clearly, he has no knowledge of history, and his diplomacy skills are terrible. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, the New York Times had the third largest distribution in the United States last year, so it should be very influential in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Therefore, this editorial should also be very influential. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, a seminar was held recently by certain former high officials of the U.S. government and certain experts specializing in the study of Asian affairs--a seminar on Sino-Japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Well, some experts raised the following viewpoint at the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They said that Sino-Japanese relations are currently in a period of extreme tension, and that there is a potential risk of military conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, they even said that the possibility that a military conflict could erupt between China and Japan was higher than the possibility that a military conflict could erupt across the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, and once a military conflict erupts, the United States is certain to be dragged in, because the U.S. would certainly become involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, a spokesperson for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also participated in the seminar said that Sino-Japanese relations are indeed in an extremely tense phase at present. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Um, any mistakes could result in severe consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Additionally, the defense and security committee of Georgia's parliament held an extended session and decided to expel, uh, the Russian peacekeeping forces in the South Ossetia region. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A general meeting of the Russian parliament will convene today for deliberations on this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Er, experts believe that if the parliament approves the expulsion of Russian peacekeeping forces, it could result in a complete rupture in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the 14th, a spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping forces said that two of the Russian peacekeeping force's military vehicles transporting food were intercepted by Georgian police, and that the drivers had been run off. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, the spokesperson then demanded that Georgian authorites immediately cease such provocative activity, otherwise Russia would not accept responsibility for the consequences of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On Monday evening, two military vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force logistics system that were transporting grain and non-staple foodstuffs encountered an inspection by Georgian police in the South Ossetia region. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Georgian police officers on duty ran the Russian drivers and escort personnel off and took the two vehicles by force and drove off in them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident raised resentment among the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping forces claims that on February 1, Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the same area, giving a traffic accident as the reason, and have yet to return the vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, they detained three Russian officers for two days and nights under the pretext of visa problems. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Georgia's intentional acts of provocation are in the hopes that a sanguinary incident will occur in the region, forcing Russian troops to open fire, in order to achieve the objective of withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces. </seg>
<seg id="27"> On the same day, the Russian embassy in Georgia took up the matter formally with Georgian authorities, demanding that Georgia cease such frenzied provocation immediately, otherwise Russia would not assume responsibility for the consequences of resulting conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Media indicated that on February 13th, Georgian defense minister Irakli Okruashivili announced that leaders of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki had sold several guided missiles used by the "Arrow" type portable guided missile system to South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On the same day, the Georgian parliament's national defense and security committee held an extended session, heard reports from force ministries, and decided to expel Russian peacekeeping forces stationed within Georgia's borders, requesting deliberation of this issue at the general meeting of parliament on the 14th. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Experts believe that once the final decision passes, it could lead to a final and total rupture in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Prior to this, Georgian foreign minister Gela Bezhuashvili harshly criticized the Russian position and rejected Russian president Vladimir Putin's statement that if the west acknowledged Kosovo, Russia could acknowledge Abkhazia and South Ossetia, believing that Russia was sending a signal of encouragement to all separatist regions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also claimed previously that it will protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia, implying the threat of direct military force against Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Admiral Gary Roughead, commander in chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, announced Tuesday that the U.S. will be dispatching four aircraft carriers to the Asia-Pacific region this summer to conduct the largest-scale military exercises in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead also said that the United States would, er, not, uh, view China, um, as a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. military hopes to be able to conduct another round of joint exercises with China's People's Liberation Army. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This statement of position immediately attracted the concern of American defense experts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Heritage Foundation, an American think tank, held a seminar Wednesday concerning the Pentagon's defense evaluation report. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The delicate relationship between the defense report and the military exercises became one of the focal points of the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some feel that Roughead's public invitation to China to participate in the military exercises is a good will gesture toward China on the part of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time that it invited China to participate in the military exercises, the U.S. also mentioned its hope that the operations of China's People's Liberation Army would become more transparent. Some defense experts therefore believe this demonstrates that the Pentagon is puzzled by China's intentions to expand its military, and hopes to use joint military exercises to  engage in mutual probing and exploration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Additionally, because the defense evaluation report issued by the Pentagon earlier this month views China as the greatest future potential threat, two defense experts have also indicated that Asia-Pacific military exercises are the U.S. Defense Department's first step toward adjusting its strategy based on this. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xie Xiaoshuang, Phoenix Satellite News, reporting from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, much attention is being focused on, uh, the American military exercises this summer, because this is the first time in ten years, ah, that the U.S. has had four, uh, aircraft carriers jointly participate in one military exercise, and, uh, it is the first time since the, uh, Vietnam War, that the U.S. has moved aircraft carriers from the east coast to the, uh, western Pacific region to conduct such military exercises. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So these military exercises are in fact quite close together--there will be four of them over several months. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, included among them will be one military exercise involving more than one country. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So this multinational military exercise will include Japan, uh, Korea and Australia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now a look at today's headlines. </seg>
<seg id="2"> On the 15th, Chinese engineers and technical personnel were attacked by gunmen in the southern Pakistan province of Balochistan. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Three engineers from Hefei in Anhui province were killed, as was their Pakistani driver. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Local police described this incident as a blatant terrorist attack. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese consulate general in Karachi has already taken up the matter with the local government, handled related matters arising from the incident, and demanded that the Pakistani authorities apprehend the assailants. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This group of Chinese engineers worked at a local concrete factory. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the 15th, on a road in the small town of Hub, about fifteen kilometers from Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan, they encountered a gunman sitting on the back of motorcycle who opened fire. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two of them died on the spot, while the other was seriously wounded and died later. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Their Pakistani driver was also killed. </seg>
<seg id="10"> All three came from Hefei in Anhui province. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The other three Chinese with them in the vehicle fortunately escaped with their lives, and were uninjured. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Chinese consulate general in Karachi said it attached a high degree of importance to this incident. </seg>
<seg id="13"> After the incident occurred, we immediately dispatched our top level counselor and consular officials to the worksite where the incident occurred to assist in handling related matters arising from the incident. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We have now relocated all of the remaining eleven engineers and technicians from this worksite to Karachi. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Additionally, the bodies of the three compatriots who were killed have been transported to a hospital in Karachi for preservation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Er, so, it should be said that after the incident occurred, we immediately took the matter up with the government of Pakistan, and strongly condemned this attack targeting Chinese nationals. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We are currently demanding that the Pakistan authorities, ah, do everything in their power to solve the case, and severely, uh, punish the assailants severely. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We have demanded that Pakistan adopt realistic security measures to ensure the personal and property safety of Chinese personnel and project teams in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="19"> After the incident, a local armed organization called the Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack, and said that they killed Chinese engineering personnel because they had joined hands with the government of Pakistan to plunder the mineral resources of local tribal residents. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Balochistan provincial police described the incident as a blatant terrorist attack in which a gunman killed innocent Chinese nationals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement promising to strengthen security measures with respect other Chinese engineering personnel, and to intensify efforts to arrest the murderers in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Phoenix Satellite News Roundup. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Additionally, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the evening of the 15th strongly condemning the shootings of the three Chinese engineers that afternoon, calling the incident a terrorist act. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The statement said,"The government and people of Pakistan strongly condemn the shootings of the Chinese engineers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "The government and people of Pakistan express deep respect for the Chinese engineers who have given their lives for the sake of Pakistan's development. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "The government and people of Pakistan express their sincere condolences to the families of the deceased." </seg>
<seg id="27"> The statement said, "The government of Pakistan is determined to strenghten protections for Chinese citizens working in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "The government will adopt all measures to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future." </seg>
<seg id="29"> The statement also said, "The shooting of the three Chinese engineers was a terrorist act intended to create a (()) in Pakistani-Chinese relations. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "The government of Pakistan will not permit such attempts to succeed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "Pakistani law enforcement authorities are in the process of adopting steps to apprehend the assailants and bring them to justice in a rapid fashion." </seg>
<seg id="32"> Additionally, late in the evening of the 15th, Chinese president Hu Jintao learned of the shootings of the Chinese engineers and technicians in Balochistan, Pakistan, resulting in three deaths. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Er, after hearing this news, he expressed a high degree of concern for the safety of Chinese engineers and technicians in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So Hu Jintao, uh, he immediately directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to demand that Pakistan apprehend the assailants and ensure the, uh, safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan, and, er, to handle the final affairs of the deceased appropriately. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Additionally, Hu Jintao also expressed deep grief for the Chinese personnel who were killed, and conveyed sincere condolences to the families of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="36"> All right, let's contact Chen Yiming, Islamabad correspondent for the People's Daily, right away to get the latest news on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Hello, Mr. Chen. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Give us an overview of the latest progress in the investigation of the shootings of the Chinese engineers. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Er, right, anchor. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Er, as I understand it from the Chinese consulate general in Karachi, um, er, China's, uh, consulate general has, uh, already informed the, uh, unit where the deceased worked of this unfortunate incident. </seg>
<seg id="41"> So, according to, uh, convention, um, the, er, final arrangements for the final affairs of the deceased should be made by their work unit, er, in consultation with, um, the families. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Additionally, Pakistan's, uh, Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="43"> His, er, the statement indicated that, um, the, uh, instigators of this incident, er, intended to sow discord in relations between China and Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Er, the statement indicated, uh, that they would conduct a thorough investigation of this incident, and, er, would, uh, strengthen security guard work with respect to all, uh, Chinese working in, um, this country, and it indicated that Pakistan would do its utmost to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Er, in addition, according to a report from Pakistan's privately-run GEO on the evening of the 15th, in an interview with that station that evening, Baber Bashir, the chief executive officer of Pakistan's Attock Cement Factory, indicated that after the occurrence of this attack, Pakistan, er, would arrange, um, for the remaining eleven Chinese engineers and technicians working on this project to return to their countries, ah, as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="46"> In the interview, this Bashir also said that concerning, ah, the doubts raised by some Pakistani media about why, er, when the incident occurred, the Chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel, er,  he said, uh, in fact, the factory where these engineers worked has its own security system, but because the location where the incident occurred was still within the scope of the factory area, there were no security personnel accompanying them when the incident occurred. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So, he expressed great regret at the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Anchor. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Er, also, this was not the first time that Chinese engineers were attacked and killed in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One previous instance of such an incident occurred in October '04. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed organization in South Waziristan. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Ultimately, one of them lost his life during the rescue operation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> And another was in May of the same year, when three engineers died in a bombing attack in Gwadar. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Let's take a look back for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On May 3, '04, in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of Pakistan's Balochistan province, a van carrying twelve Chinese nationals encountered a car bombing attack on its way to a worksite at the harbor. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The result: three Chinese engineers died, and nine were injured. </seg>
<seg id="58"> It is believed that this attack was initiated by local separatists and tribal militias. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in the South Waziristan region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> During an attempt to rescue the hostages by Pakistani forces soon thereafter, one of the engineers was unfortunately shot and killed. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, this hostage incident is believed to have been perpetrated by an armed organization related to a jihadist organization, not by the separatist militia. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Because China has a close economic relationship with Pakistan, and is participating in the construction of Pakistan's infrastructure, a good many Chinese engineering personnel work there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> And Pakistan has tribal militia organizations accusing the government of plundering their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> This has resulted in multiple instances of Chinese people becoming the victims of attacks and kidnappings. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at several news stories from Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Recently there was this bit of relatively shocking news from Japan's world of politics. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Which was that Tsuneo Watanabe, the, um, chairman of Japanese media giant Yomiuri Shimbun, ordered, uh, Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles opposing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, and Yomiuri Shimbun's, um, position since then has, uh, been in opposition to Koizumi's visit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Uh, so, in a speech several days ago, this Tsuneo Watanabe, uh, he criticized Koizumi severely, saying that he was extremely ignorant and lacked any historical or cultural knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the same time, he also said that a visit by Koizumi to the Yasukuni Shrine would be like paying tribute to Hitler, and he said that by doing so, Koizumi would cause China and Korea to view Japan as an extremely dangerous country, and this would be a constant source of trouble in the future. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So why would this attitude of Tsuneo Watanabe's cause such a great commotion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, he is very influential in political circles, and has always been a controlling character behind the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And he, uh, was a person who was far to the right in the past. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It should be said that he has always supported the hawk faction, and he has worked hard to promote amendment of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But, uh, now, he has truly made a major about face. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He has turned the muzzle of his gun and begun shooting at Koizumi, adopting an attitude of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, when people attacked Koizumi for visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in 2004, this Tsuneo Watanabe still said, uh, he said he supported it, and he wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But in a recent talk, he said, "I'm already over eighty years old, I don't have much time left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> So now, he comes out in lofty tones, speaking out with a sort of very anti-war attitude. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The effect of this, um, change of sides on his part on Japanese society as a whole naturally remains great. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For example, concerning himself, he said, "I firmly believe I have this kind of assurance and the ability to change political trends." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He also said that if Yomiuri Shimbun received government pressure in the areas of free speech and editorial freedom, he would resist it with his life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So what kind of situation has taken shape now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Japan's biggest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, and Japan's second biggest newspaper, the super Asahi Shimbun, have begun to join hands in opposition to Koizumi's Yasukuni Shrine visits. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, these two major papers were at odds with each other, but after the two chairmen met, they at least reached a consensus on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus now, both of them have adopted major offensives to, uh, criticize Koizumi. They can be said to be a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In fact, these two major newspapers should still have, uh, enormous influence on mainstream public opinion in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Also, let's take a look at the current legislative session in Japan. At a recent meeting, two of the more popular candidates to succeed Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi both said the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who are these two? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Yes, one is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Tari Aso, who has repeatedly made astonishing statements recently. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What did the two of them say? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They said that Japan's, uh, World War II war criminals were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they meant was, uh, it was the international court that called them, um, criminals, and convicted them of crimes. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But domestically in Japan, based on international law, based on Japan's domestic laws, they, the war criminals, had not violated Japan's domestic laws. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, they believe that Japan should not view the World War II war criminals as criminals. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, this Shinzo Abe also mentioned that Japan should now turn its eyes to the world at large, develop its relationship with the United States, develop its trade relationships with certain southeast Asian countries, and do its utmost to develop a close relationship with India, and not always focus on China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Hope but No Assurance for Championship </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Love life love Luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The battle field of China's Soccer Superbowl will soon see war。 </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Luneng Taishan (of Shandong Province) soccer team is getting ready for the next season, preparing to make another advance for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Three strong teams, Dalian, Luneng, and Shanghai, will fight for the championship </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the end, who will be the champion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> According to analysis of their strength, although the Luneng team has great hope of winning the championship, it does not have 100% assurance. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First of all, the new players only have a short time to train and be broken in. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Last year Luneng came home empty from the four big games. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This year Luneng has brought in two famous national players, Li Leilei and Wang Liang, and soon there will be two foreign players that will join the ranks as well.  The team's power can be said to have had increases and no decreases. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, because the national team must prepare for competitions with Pakistan and Iraq, the national players won't be able to practice with their team mates. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When they finally return to their club, the tournament will begin shortly; </seg>
<seg id="13"> thus the breaking in and integration of new players is the biggest problem faced by Luneng. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I think that in the first few rounds of the tournament they should let the national players play second string. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Firstly they can use the competitions to break in and integrate the ranks, </seg>
<seg id="16"> and secondly they can allow these players who played in two national group competitions to rest a bit. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After a few rounds, when the 'knives' are broken in, it will not be too late for them to come into play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also, the team has hidden trouble with its defense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the past, Luneng's defense has been denounced by fans, </seg>
<seg id="20"> This year, with the addition of Li Leilei, the team's defense has improved but is far from being foolproof. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The problem of middle rear guards being slow at turning around the ball still exists, and second string players are either too old or lack experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If middle rear guards are stable in their abilities this year, then another step will be taken toward Luneng's road to the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I believe that the team should use Ren Yongshun, whose physical condition is good.  Although he lacks experience, he can train this year, and prepare for the present and future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Besides this, Gao Yao is good at playing both forward and rear positions . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Luneng has many players that can play center field, Cui Peng and Hai Bin can play this position. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Yao's body is strong, he's good at stealing the ball, and in the position of middle rear guard he should be able to do a good job. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Once again, if the foreign players will be suitable or not is a problem. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Foreign players are a big problem that has always complicated Luneng. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Last year, the unleashing of Ionel Danciulescu left many unimpressed, </seg>
<seg id="30"> and selections for this year's foreign players have still not been made. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that this year, besides bringing in a extraordinary forward, they should also bring in a pure left forward guard, </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except for Xing Rui from several years ago, Luneng doesn't have a left footer in the true meaning. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although Cui Peng and other can live up to the position, a true left forward guard would be much better than guest players. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three problems are resolved, Luneng's road to gain the championship should be more even. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Luneng fan, I hope that Luneng wins the championship this year, </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, to tell the truth, the shape of this year's championship has Luneng with great hopes but no great assurances. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Spring festival has once again run past us just like that, and those friends who put their vacation time and their Spring Festival holiday break together are one by one returning to their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Wishing all friends a happy New Year, if I say happy New Year now it doesn't count as too late. </seg>
<seg id="6"> One day I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe, and he talked about today's BrandVista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The website is much more beautiful, </seg>
<seg id="8"> the placement of content isn't bad, </seg>
<seg id="9"> and what he liked most was the community BBS based on Discuz, which is now getting a comprehensive update. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Mentioning the community, I must thank a certain person, </seg>
<seg id="11"> that is the General Manager of the Discuz Beijing Company, Mr. Li Mingshun. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Doing a search on Google with his name, you'll get many results; </seg>
<seg id="13"> you probably know that before he was at Sina, he established a business himself, making a small- and medium-enterprise Internet advertisement exchange platform similar to the foreign adbrite.com. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At that time I argued with him on MSN that his main meaning was: Vista thinks the development of many of China's industries relies on the strengthening of the private economy and small and medium industries, </seg>
<seg id="15"> and currently in the Chinese market, this situation does not allow people to be optimistic; </seg>
<seg id="16"> thus creative industries and similar consultative agencies in service of small and medium enterprises have no way to take shape in any scope, </seg>
<seg id="17"> and demand a relatively high fee to facilitate self development, finally leading to a recurring cycle that is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he came to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is a truly outstanding community program based on the PHP and MySQL databases; </seg>
<seg id="20"> with the help of Beijing technical engineer Ramboo, the BrandVista community finally saw light once again, and came into the market in full force. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Feedback has been very good, </seg>
<seg id="22"> the user interface is clean and friendly, </seg>
<seg id="23"> the speed is fast; </seg>
<seg id="24"> under a spotlessly clean user interface, writing a little text that leaves me inspired and others enlightened, and exchanging every little fact about life and work with friends and coworkers with the same pursuits, I began to believe that this is a kind of joy. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thank you Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> News in the advertisement industry of late is rather substantial. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Beginning in January, the WTO's opening up of institutions related to the advertisement industry will begin to be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Major foreigners have already arrived one after another, and lesser foreigners are sharpening their knives; it seems to be a scene of prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The problems of Batey Ads of Singapore are rather numerous; </seg>
<seg id="30"> under the circumstances of consecutively losing several heavyweight customers, and seeing setback after setback on the mainland, Sir Martin finally took a little time from the Italian lawsuit to think about shuffling his cards. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Look at this article, and share it; </seg>
<seg id="4"> this is not an impulse on thought, instead it is warm goodness long held in one's heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Ask yourself if it were you, what would you have done; </seg>
<seg id="6"> the answer is very clear, I would have put down the telephone saying, "wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> This year I have been thinking about when all is said and done, what actually counts as helping people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have already abandoned all behaviors like donating money and donating items. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the last few days I've had friends say, I already have no time to care for myself; in helping people, my heart is full of vigor but by my strength lacking. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wishing you a day of happiness : ) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mother of Ten Years Ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> It was one day ten years ago when this teacher was using the noon rest time to sleep at her home; suddenly the telephone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She received the call and listened, and out came a strange and rough sound: "your child was stealing books and now she's been caught by us, come quickly!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> From out of the receiver also came the noise of a young girl crying, and the sounds of chiding from people surrounding the young girl. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She looked over at her only daughter who was watching TV, and she immediately understood. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It was definitely a young girl who was caught by the salesperson stealing books, but was not willing to allow her family to learn of this; thus, she made up a phone number, and by coincidence it rung at the teacher's home. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course the teacher could put down the phone and take no notice of this -- she could even rebuke the person on the receiving end, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this event had no connection to her whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But she was a teacher, and maybe the girl was her student </seg>
<seg id="21"> through the telephone, she could vaguely imagine that the little girl who had a momentary lapse in judgment with serious consequences must be extremely nervous and scared; she was facing perhaps the most frightening circumstances ever in her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After hesitating for a moment the teacher suddenly thought of an idea -- yes, she'd just do it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Therefore, after she got the address of the bookstore, she immediately went there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Just as she expected, in the bookstore stood a little girl with a face full of tears, </seg>
<seg id="25"> and the adults around her were fiercely chiding her. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She rushed up at once, hugging that poor little girl and turning to the salesperson by her side, saying, "talk to me about this, don't frighten the child." </seg>
<seg id="27"> While the salesperson grumbled that he was not willing, she handed over a fine of several tens of RMB before taking this little girl out of the bookstore and getting a clear look at a face in a complete mess with tears and panic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She began smiling and took the little girl to her home, cleaned her up without asking anything, and then allowed the little girl to leave. </seg>
<seg id="29"> before she left, the teacher urged her: "if you want to read, just come to me; there are many books here." </seg>
<seg id="30"> The little girl whose spirits were still rattled took a good look at her, and then ran off like she was flying, never appearing again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time passed rapidly like running water, and without realizing it, ten years of time had passed in a flash; </seg>
<seg id="32"> the teacher had already forgotten this event long ago, but she still lived in the same place, leading a peaceful and serene life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One day at noon, a knocking sound came from outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> After she had opened the house door, she saw a young and beautiful unfamiliar girl, who had a face full of smiles and a large pile of gifts in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?," </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked uncertainly. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The girl then excitingly talked at length. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With great difficulty, she suddenly discovered from the story told by this strange girl that it turned out she was the little girl from before, ten years before; she had already graduated from college without any trouble, and now she had gone to the trouble to come to pay a call to the teacher. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The eyes of this young girl were glinting with tears, and she spoke softly: "Although I still don't understand even to this day why were you willing to pretend you were my mother and rescue me, I always think, during these past ten years, about how I've always wanted to call you mother." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes also began to become fuzzy; </seg>
<seg id="41"> she asked with some curiosity: "if that day I had not helped you, what would have been the result?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> The girl's face immediately became somber; lightly she shook her head and said; "I can't say for sure; perhaps I would have done something stupid, even died." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The teacher's heart suddenly trembled and she began to inwardly congratulate herself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The decision that she made in a moment of thought that year could actually influence the life of a person in such a way as this. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smiles on the face of the girl she also began to smile. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Military Survey: How Long Can Iran Last Against American Air Strikes? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If you make the analogy of a traditional war of attrition as making your opponent bleed until he dies, then modern warfare is like firing a gun into your opponent's head, making him become a 'vegetable' before he can even begin to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The difference between Iran and America's military does not lie in numbers, instead it lies in the understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq with no clear winner, still seems to not have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the last few days, after analyzing the redeployment of American forces, England's "International Intelligence Commentary" pointed out that American forces are currently carrying out preparations to initiate a large scale air strike against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Current Situation of Iran's Air Force Worrisome </seg>
<seg id="8"> The current situation of Iran's air force is relatively similar to Iraq's air force before the 2003 war. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Iran does not have the ability to research and develop modern weapons by itself, and also is restricted by a Western arms embargo; </seg>
<seg id="10"> as soon as a war breaks out, whether or not the old aircraft in Iran's air force will be able to get into the air and engage American forces is still a big question. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At present, Iran's air defense system is mainly made up of the air forces of Iran's regular army, land air defense units, and the air defense forces of the Revolutionary Guards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Among its forces, Iran's air force has approximately 50,000 soldiers, and has over 300 war aircraft of various types; </seg>
<seg id="13"> its main models include American-made F-4 'Phantoms', F-5 'Tigers', F-14 'Tomcats' and Russian-made Mig 29s and so on. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Land-based air defense units are mainly equipped with a series of American-made 'Hawks', British 'Rapiers' and some Russian-made 'SAM' land-to-air missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As to the present situation of Iran's air defense power, American military expert Harold Hutchinson and Russian Government and Military Analysis Institute military expert Vladimir Mytashin and others have analyzed this.  They believe that, looking at the current situation, there still exist some leaks in Iran's air defense abilities and the air defense system establishment. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchinson believes that, talking about its comprehensive strength, Iran's air forces and America's military are just not on the same level. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A great number of American-made fighters that Iran is equipped with cannot be used because they lack spare parts and need upgraded maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> As of now only about 10 or a few more of the F-14 fighters which were once seen as the trump card in Iran's air force can even get off the ground and fly, </seg>
<seg id="19"> and the actual battle reliability of the AIM-54 model 'Phoenix' cruise missile, which is reputed to have over the horizon strike ability, is suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Mytashin points out that the air defense missile systems that America supplied to Iran in the 70's and 80's have already lost their battle abilities because they lack spare parts, </seg>
<seg id="21"> and some other air defense weapons not incorporated into their own systems obtained from Russia and other countries have no ability whatsoever to contend with American forces that have strong electromagnetic countermeasures. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A Pieced Together Force Influences Iran's Fighting Power </seg>
<seg id="23"> Iran's government obviously has recognized that its fate in a war depends on whether or not it can defend the skies above its head, and has thus made preparations at the last minute, and tried to further piece together and strengthen its air defense systems. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Looking at this at the present, Iran's method can be boiled down to these two strategies: </seg>
<seg id="25"> First, hide important nuclear facilities with the utmost effort, and strengthen their ability to resist attack. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to England's "The Times," Iran already has deeply hidden its Natanz nuclear factory and Isfahan uranium enrichment center 18 meters underground, and added a two-meter thick concrete protecting shell. </seg>
<seg id="27"> However, American forces are one step ahead.  As early as during the 1991 Gulf War, America had seen the efficiency of underground bunkers in air defense warfare and carried out an onslaught of research and development on various kinds of earth-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After more than 10 years of specific research and development, American forces now already have a whole series of battle methods and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Recently Iran also purchased advanced air defense weapons from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since late last year, the Iranian government and Russia have successively reached agreements on the purchase of 'Pechora' 2A model air defense missile systems, as well as 29 'Tor" M1 model air defense missile systems worth 700 million USD. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, modern warfare is a measuring of system against system. </seg>
<seg id="32"> All of America's various air strike weapons were researched and developed by America, have seen many years of actual battle hardening, and have already been ground into a set of battle machines with objective effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Whereas Iran has been piecing together 'new weapons' from other countries.  It is still a question if Iran can create any battle power in such a short time. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Iran's Deficiencies Not Only in Weapons </seg>
<seg id="35"> The 'AirLand Battle' concept was first brought up in "Operations" published by the U.S. armed forces in 1982.  It emphasized taking advantage of air superiority to carry out strikes on the enemy's strategic high value targets, and paralyzing the command system of the enemy as soon as war began, making enemies with even large and strong regular armed forces just "a piece of meat on the cutting board." </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War, what American forces have been concerned about is not how many aircraft the opponent has, but instead the range of its 'Tomahawk' cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The Iranian government is already carrying out preparations for air strikes that might happen, and has also begun procedures to strengthen its air defense abilities. However, Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq with no clear winner, still seems not to have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the progress of military restructuring of American forces over the past few years, America's air strike performance is already totally different than the carpet bombing of the Vietnam era, and instead relies on various high-tech weapons, the support of high accuracy current information technology and total-depth air strike ability. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Facing these kind of air strikes, exactly how long Iran's land-based air defense systems can last is still an unknown. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Joining With Google to Take on Microsoft, Dell Takes "Shelving Fees" From Software Providers </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Dell (Dell Inc. US) and Google verified on Tuesday that Dell is currently testing the installation of a Google software package on personal computers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This move will likely become a serious threat to the leading position in the personal computer software market of Microsoft (Microsoft Corp, MSFT). </seg>
<seg id="5"> Jess Blackburn, news spokesman for Dell, expressed that his company is currently evaluating Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After installing this software, personal computer users can use it to carry out searches on the Internet and also search the information saved on personal computers. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn verified that at present the software his company is evaluating includes a Dell homepage supported by Google, a Google desktop search system and a Google tool bar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, Google news spokesman Jon Murchinson verified his company is currently testing a batch of software developed by Google with Dell. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Before this, "The Wall Street Journal" had a report saying that IT parvenu Google is currently carrying out talks with Dell, HP (Hewlett-Packard) and others, aiming to convince these computer manufacturing giants to install Google software on their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to "The Wall Street Journal," which cited a person with inside information, to reach this goal Google will likely pay as much as one billion USD to Dell over the next three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, neither of the two companies has revealed any relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Besides this, HP has declined to comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Microsoft news spokesperson Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At present, Microsoft is currently planning to release the search tools of the next generation Windows operating system, as well as strengthening the development of its online services. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The day that this news became public, Google stock once again fell by 4.46%, reaching 367.92 USD. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft stock fell 1% that day, closing at 26.94 USD. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts point out that Google is currently impatiently searching for a direction for expansion besides internet searches, and joining with Dell and other PC giants will spur Google on to threaten Microsoft's central services. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Analyst Matt Rosoff of market research company Directions on Microsoft expressed that Google is impatient to expand new income flows.  This is certainly what Microsoft is concerned and worried about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, there are also analysts who don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Analyst Charles Di Bona of market analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows' leading position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Noted by the Reporter: Google Loosening Up Microsoft's Empire? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hui Zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> There is no doubt that computers have already become a necessity of life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, while everybody is familiar with operating computers, there are only a small number of people who actually understand the principles that make computers work. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Just like using 'simpleton' cameras, as long as the user interface is good and you use convenient software, the great majority of dummies can still thoroughly enjoy their computer . </seg>
<seg id="26"> Because of this, the software that PC producers provide when they ship their goods often decides the use habits of a large number of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Microsoft has firmly taken hold of the personal computer operating system market through this measure. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As of now, Microsoft's new opponent Google also intends to use this method to take a share for itself. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A famous Taiwanese economic media outlet recently gave an interesting analogy to this. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Dell, HP and other computer producers are starting to manage the computers they are sending out as the product shelves in a supermarket, and taking a "shelving fee" from software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Successful bidders can make their software appear in the 'crucial 10 minutes' when users first turn on their new computers, and lead consumers to use their products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This type of fee pattern is like supermarkets taking a shelving fee from food suppliers." </seg>
<seg id="33"> There is no doubt that this phenomenon shows that Microsoft's control is currently loosening. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Microsoft managers have warned Bill Gates that if Google starts to pay personal computer manufacturers to allow computers to be deployed with Google's software, then Microsoft's hegemonic position will in the end be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> No matter what the final result is, the leisurely days of Microsoft sitting in the lead position will likely become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, fighting an empire is easy, but defending an empire is hard. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Sword of Righteousness: Looking Forward to 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: sword of righteousness </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember at the beginning of 2005, Hong Kong's "Apple Daily" published an article; its title was "The Falun wheel turns often to capture the enemy nation." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article said that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced triumphantly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article enumerated that all the manners in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) overseas officials took to repress Falun Gong in various situations all failed, and students of Falun Gong across the world spoke the truth and left the CCP without any face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But if you compare the great surge of those quitting the party because of the "Nine Criticisms" of 2005, then 2004 really doesn't seem like much. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So, what will 2006 bring? </seg>
<seg id="10"> From two events that happened early this year we can get an inkling as to the development of this year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first event is the publishing of "Eradicating Evil."  This article pronounces a sentence that the final day of the CCP's special operatives after July 20, 1999 will soon arrive. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In regards to this article, perhaps many people will waver between believing or doubting it, or will not be able to believe it, </seg>
<seg id="13"> but no matter if you believe it or not, history and fact will provide proof! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, the special operatives of the CCP are just like rats that live in the sewer, </seg>
<seg id="15"> their "natural or unnatural" death will not bring the attention of society or public opinion, </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, the large-scale smiting or repentance of domestic and foreign based CCP operatives will bring about a huge attack and convulsion to the CCP power hierarchy! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Under the awful magnitude of the smiting of their world, they will have to seriously consider their path of retreat and path of life -- quit the party, revolt and run, or change sides. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Because of this, the 'CCP hyper-stable bureaucratic system bloc' held up by filthy interests will begin to shake, dissolve and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> There is also one event, that is, the hunger strike movement against those maintaining power begun by Gao Zhisheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This movement that began suddenly and was not well received at first, exceeded expectations and received an enthusiastic response from all over the world, and was responded to jointly by figures and forces everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this movement can become a nexus between various righteous powers and the suffering people, as well as become successful and large, then the final hit to the CCP, this wicked regime that is on the precipice ready to fall, will be given. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If we say that 2005 was the year that defeated communism on the spiritual level, then 2006 is the stage of defeating communism on a spiritual and material level. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With the further promulgation of the "Nine Criticisms," the deepening of the tide of people quitting the party, the self-dissolution of the CCP itself and the agglomeration and shaping up of outside righteous power, the life of the CCP monster will formally enter its final hours! </seg>
<seg id="24"> The desires of heaven and earth have already coalesced, the hand of God and the power of the people are currently assembling. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The long sword that relies on heaven is directly pointed at the CCP monster! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If you say 2004 was a year in which we advanced triumphantly, and 2005 is a year in which we surged forward with great momentum, then what will the end words be for 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it will be a huge change that startles heaven, victory and triumphant return! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Title: Xu Zhiyong: a Letter to Linyi City Committee Secretary Li Qun - Gangster Methods Will Hurt You </seg>
<seg id="6"> Posting Website: Like old friends even though we just met (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> As of yesterday, the Linyi government that you lead has already illegally held Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You have joined with the gangster underworld to illegally imprison a legal citizen who has been blind in both eyes for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You cut the telephone line in his home, and installed cell phone disrupting equipment in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You have also beaten up his family members on numerous occasions. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Your barbaric actions have already passed beyond the bottom margin of civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October 2005 you used gangster methods to beat up me and lawyer Li Fangping, but we endured it, and always did our best to understand your difficulties, even tolerating you putting Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for a time. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, 165 days have passed, and you have not constrained yourselves, and instead have become even more severe. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You send out large teams of police and gangsters to harass the village citizens. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You continue to arrest and beat up village citizens. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You have already gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, while you continue to organize gangsters to surround and block Cheng Guangcheng, I clearly remind you that gangster methods will in the end hurt yourself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The beginning of the situation is worth your looking back and thinking about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Linyi's Family Planning is dead last for the entire province, </seg>
<seg id="20"> and as the secretary of the city committee, you being somewhat worried is understandable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, thinking that you can only use violence and force to implement national legal policies because Linyi's citizens are unsophisticated is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Citizens not cooperating with the behavior of the government, in the end whose fault is this? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it because citizens are unsophisticated, or is it because the government has for a long time used lies and deceits leading to very low public confidence? </seg>
<seg id="24"> If you say that 10 years ago this kind of governmental behavior still didn't seem that preposterous; then in 2005, when Chinese society has already had obvious improvements and human rights protection has already been added into the constitution, don't you think that your barbaric behavior is far off the mark? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why don't you think about it a bit?  Why is it only you guys in Linyi that still dare to do stuff like this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How is it that you guys in Linyi cannot use democratic and legal methods to enforce the law? </seg>
<seg id="27"> When Chen Guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported the facts of this barbaric enforcing of the law, through the involvement of Teng Biao and a group of lawyers bravely maintaining the rights of citizens and after the State Family Planning Committee completed its investigations, Linyi City could have heartily given an explanation and come to an understanding with the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After all, family planning is a problem characteristic of China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Everybody could have understood and forgiven your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However, you took further absurd actions - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back.  You also implicated him in the crime of illegally providing national confidential information. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you think that this crime is rather absurd for a blind person who lives in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> Actually, you only need to correct your mistakes, you only need to do good.  Do you really fear the criticism of a blind person? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Do you really have to assign over 10 people to watch over him 24 hours a day and even try to pin utterly preposterous crimes onto him? </seg>
<seg id="34"> On October 4, 2005, Lawyer Li Fangping and I went to the ancient village of Dongshi where we expressed an extremely clear standpoint hoping to resolve this contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We suggested that we first talk with your officials, and see what ideas and demands you had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We took the initiative and suggested we would help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to say certain things. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We hoped that you wouldn't treat a blind person in such ways, and both parties should have concessions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, your decision maker insisted on doing things his own way and he even set up a "meticulous scheme" of his own - to beat us up and illegally detain us. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think you can frighten us into submission in this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We have done nothing against the law, </seg>
<seg id="41"> we have no fear, </seg>
<seg id="42"> and although China's rule of law is not perfect, it is not that there is no law and no heaven above. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Do you think you can frighten us into submission by using gangster methods?  Then you have seriously underestimated our resolve and perseverance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As long as we are willing, we have many people and many legal reasons to go to Linyi, or go and see Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat up lawyer and scholar once, twice, three times; every time will be widely reported and paid attention to. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you really dare to beat us 10 times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Are you not very concerned with your official post? </seg>
<seg id="48"> If there is anybody who is really hurt, is your official position that secure? </seg>
<seg id="49"> If you do not listen to our reasonable advice, and instead employ some low-level gangster methods, don't you think this is very dangerous and very foolish? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to clearly tell you that in China there are many outstanding citizens who obey the law and are true to their consciences. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We aren't afraid of the gangster underworld, </seg>
<seg id="52"> and we cannot abide the wanton trampling of the lowest margin of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you go too far, we will confidently and calmly face your clubs with group after group and go forward until you finally shrink back. </seg>
<seg id="54"> It should be clear to you, using gangster methods is nothing good for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Don't think that you can hide behind a curtain and be free of your relationship with those ruffian gangsters who beat up villagers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> In the end, I want to remind you, please be nice to Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This person who has been blind since childhood, graduated from the Institute of Chinese Medicine, self-studied law and English, once sued Beijing's Subway Company to get better benefits for the blind, brought running water to the villagers, and became the famous "Lawyer Chen" known near and far. </seg>
<seg id="58"> You went as far as using shameless persons to slander him on the Internet, and also tried to frame him with the crime of illegally providing confidential information to foreigners.  Don't you think that you have gone too far? </seg>
<seg id="59"> Your house arrest of Chen Guangcheng is illegal, and is dangerous to you as well. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Originally you could have released him, </seg>
<seg id="61"> and although your barbaric execution of the law would have stopped, even if he criticized you, how long could he go on? </seg>
<seg id="62"> Instead, today you are continuing to further debase your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> As long as Chen Guangcheng does not get freedom, you will not get one day of rest. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Your torture of him is already enough, </seg>
<seg id="65"> and if you still want to pin a crime on him or still want to utilize further gangster methods, we will definitely not stand to the side and just watch. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Exploring China's peaceful path to liberation, pushing for the internal liberation of my countrymen. </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I am extremely disappointed to admit: The Chinese ethnicity does not deserve democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Aren't the people posting here doing just this thing! </seg>
<seg id="5"> It's just sad that people on the Internet seeing this are not many (compared to 1.4 billion), </seg>
<seg id="6"> The number of people who are online and are concerned and take part in these types of subjects is even smaller: I am confident in asserting - they are less than 1% of those that use the Internet! </seg>
<seg id="7"> And what about this Internet having the largest, most comprehensive, most advanced, most expensive, and best security programs in the world! </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Agony, disappointment, helplessness, even thinking of submission; but to live one's life, besides fighting yourself, who can you place hope on? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although the planning of affairs rests with man, to complete affairs rests with heaven. Still, even if my plans do not succeed, if I do not work hard towards my ideals I will believe that I myself am wrong and deserve to live the life of a dog. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Working hard towards righteousness, I will add some beauty to my life in this way alone, at least in my heart and in my appraisal of myself. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, I don't need to be worried with China's future at all, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the world environment already cannot allow a regime that for a such a long time has not used elections. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It's only a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It's just that I sigh that the Chinese ethnicity is 'extremely lucky', we have always been put on a hellish path of torture and awfulness during the turns of history by world classed and superman classed monsters.  Even though some call the high piles of bones and pools of blood this path extracts as glorious, and force us to be proud of our gloriousness. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Dark nights are everywhere, China is endless. </seg>
<seg id="17"> With China's first emperor Qinshihuang and Confucius, the people violently died young. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Qinshihuang was openly a tyrant, Confucius brain washed covertly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It's not that Chinese are not deserving of democracy, it's that the genes of democracy have already been repressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> For a nation that has been around for three thousand years, if its ethnic culture had democratic genes, then this nation would have much earlier become a democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> When Athens established a democratic system, when Rome established a republic, when the English passed the Magna Carta, when the French published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, when Americans published the Declaration of Independence, what were the Chinese doing? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the Mongolians came into the central China plains, the Mongols elected a leader at the Kurultai, the Manchurians had democratic discussions of government between the King and ministers, why is it when they came to the Han region these tendencies were put out? </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Chinese pursue material resources, and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual beliefs and political power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I don't believe it.  If Chinese had universal suffrage, they'd sell it for a salty pancake. </seg>
<seg id="25"> 500,000 years later, if the Chinese want democracy, then there will certainly need to be an earthquake; those who can run, run! </seg>

<seg id="3"> Special Envoy of the Dalai Lama Carries Out Closed Meetings with Chinese Officials </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Dalai Lama has emphasized that he hopes Tibet will be autonomous but not independent. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The special envoy of the Dalai Lama, exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, is currently in Beijing carrying out closed meetings with Chinese officials, but the details have not been released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth formal meeting with the exiled government of the Dalai Lama since 2002 when China reinstated ties. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, it's the same as before, both sides are carrying out closed meetings and the details have not been revealed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reporters say that both sides have carried out multiple talks, but as of now they still do not have any results of real substance. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dali Lama, exiled in north India, said that he hopes for Tibet to be autonomous, not independent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> China refused to comment on the two party talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, analysts say that Beijing looks forward to the two party talks, some reasons being that it's worried if the 70 year old spiritual leader dies, it will likely lead to an increase of unsatisfactory sentiments of Tibetans toward Chinese rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural Identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> The delegation of the Dali Lama's exiled government are lead by Kelsang Gyaltsen.  He has also been the leading representative for the past several meetings. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The spokesperson for the Tibet exiled government said that the several talks carried out with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were extremely "confidential and frank."  This brings hope to Tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesperson said that their final hope is to reach a groundwork with the Chinese leadership according to the talks, resolve relevant problems, allow Tibetans to have freedom, and maintain their cultural identity which they believe is important. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Special Envoy of Dali Lama has Repeated he Does Not Seek Independence </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Dali Lama will go to Washington this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Before the Dali Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, arrives in America on November 8, his special envoy expressed that the exiled Tibetan government does not demand Tibetan independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Kelsang Gyaltsen said in Washington that they hope the Chinese government can indeed protect the unique culture and traditions of Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It's predicted that when the Dali Lama visits America next week he will discuss the problem of Tibet with President Bush, and hope Bush will urge the Chinese government to give Tibet true autonomous power. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Dali Lama's representatives and Beijing officials carried out direct contact this July in Berne. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "True Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Kelsang Gyaltsen pointed out that in the last several years the Tibet exiled government and Chinese authorities have see some positive aspects during talks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The special envoy of the Dali Lama discovered that Beijing leaders, especially representatives of the United Front Work Department of CPC Central Committee were willing to listen to their viewpoints. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Kelsang Gyaltsen said that the Tibet exiled government and the Chinese government still had too many divergences, and the standpoint of both sides had too great a difference. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that in the last five years, the exiled Tibetan government had already done all it could to respond to China's demand of creating a good environment for talks, </seg>
<seg id="28"> and China should also create a good environment for the Tibet problem, and not just attack the Dali Lama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said that the Dali Lama does not demand Tibetan independence, and Tibet is a part of China, but the Chinese government must protect the unique culture of Tibet and "allow Tibetans to truly have autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> Besides this, Kelsang Gyaltsen pointed out that some Chinese think that once the Dali Lama dies, the Tibet problem will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said this way of thinking is extremely dangerous, because once the Dali Lama is not around, China will have lost a historic opportunity to resolve the Tibet problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that, as long as the Chinese government is responsive to the demands brought up by the Dali Lama, and puts forth a final method of resolution, the Dali Lama will then not need to discuss the Tibet problem in the international community. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Negotiations and Compromise are Important Methods of Democracy! (ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I just saw the post of an Internet friend on "Vast Righteousness - Give Old Mr. Gui Ren." </seg>
<seg id="4"> His (her) original words were: "Negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy, otherwise democracy will fail because opinions are different and splits form!!!  This point should be amply paid attention to by those hoping for ideal democracy!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> These light and unflavorful words that did not stir any interest in my online friends got me thinking and lamenting. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At this time I wanted to go to ancient China, and I also wanted to go to the past of the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I, who seldom post main threads, could not help but post a main thread to reply to this post of my online friend. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First let us look at ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everybody knows that China has been a centralized power since the first emperor, Qinshihuang, established a unified China.  After that all dynasties operated under this governmental framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although in the Han period they implemented a "two track system" for a short time, it was just a governmental system of simultaneous operation of feudalist and central power mechanisms, and in the end central power won out. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The results of this type of central power system had its progressive side under the historic conditions of the time, and promoted the development of production capability. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, we should see that the results of over two thousand years of operating under this system has lead to locations lacking the ingenuity, initiative, and pro-activeness they should have; and in no way could that system set various governing policies suitable for local development with actions that suit local situations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A pyramid-like governing system also led to lower level officials only looking upward, in all respects taking orders from the next higher level. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because the local officials of county seats were all appointed by the central government,  there was no space for concessions and negotiations, and don't even bother to bring up the common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the rights of ancient Chinese farmers were encroached on, they could only endure it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Only when their most basic rights were threatened - that is large scale starvation and the right of life being exploited by cruel government or natural disasters - would they raise up flags and resist. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over two thousand years numerous peasant rebellions have swept across the nation; from ones that had no forethought such as that led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang to the planned Yellow Turban Uprising, and again the Huangchao violence of the Tang Dynasty, and the Li Zicheng uprising that ruled as a dynasty for one month.  Except for Zhu Yuanzhang, all of these did not gain victory in the true meaning. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty established by Zhu Yuanzhang was no more than the replacing of one dynasty with another, and there weren't changes in the system of government. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Zhu Yuanzhang, who was born a commoner and did not have much culture, took China's ancient centralized power system to an abnormal and extreme state, therein losing the vigorous and vital aspects of freedom and tolerance of the Tang Dynasty that system enjoyed, making the system inert. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Any room for discussions of freedom disappeared on the Chinese mainland, </seg>
<seg id="21"> the nature of humanity received the greatest suppression, </seg>
<seg id="22"> and everyone became overcautious, in awe and reverence of the government, and did not dare to say too much. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This was the aftermath of the only peasant rebellion that was successful in two thousand years, leaving the Chinese people with a meager existence for a time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now let's look at the Middle Ages that are called the Dark Ages in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Western Europe's Middle Ages was a thousand year era that took shape after western Rome was destroyed by nomadic peoples.  These Middle Ages had no connection to ancient Greece and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This era's main characteristic was feudalism, that is dividing up lands; </seg>
<seg id="27"> land was divided up further and further among lords and the lower levels had more self-governing rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> No matter if one was a small feudal lord of a few square kilometers of land, or a male aristocrat with a royal title; because those higher and lower could mutually balance, restrict, and rely on each other, they had the conditions and ability to strive for the rights they should have from their king.  This produced the situation of kings and aristocrats sitting together and carrying out negotiations for each one's benefits that was never seen in ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They made mutual concessions, and did not use violent methods to beat down and replace opponents. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In this way, by setting various contracts, power continuously was released into the hands of aristocrats and commoners, the rights of aristocrats and commoners became greater and greater, and the power of the king lesser and lesser. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Until finally the English Queen was just a empty position, and did not have any real power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Democracy was gradually realized in this way! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Now look back and compare, in ancient China, where all power was concentrated in the hands of the emperor (except for Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty) with almost no aristocrats, peasants could not easily enjoy a kettle of tea or cup of wine with them at the negotiating table, and mutually compromise in a relaxed and happy way to set up contracts with both sides happy. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under this situation, when the right to life was being exploited, they could only take up violent methods to topple the current dynasty, aiming to replace them. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The result was successive dynasties, from the high point of the Tang Dynasty to the abnormal situation of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparing Chinese and western history, we learn there seems to be not one western country who in ancient times had such intensified contradictions between those in power and those ruled over as in China. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There is not one western country that was like ancient China and had endless peasant uprisings. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In western countries, when the ancient royal households and peasants had contradictions, the aristocrats and commoners appealing for their own benefits thought first to reach resolutions through the method of negotiations, and made some mutual concessions to gradually gain more rights.  Only rarely did they take up the method of violence. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding from this, now that we have entered the 21st century, on the Internet one can still see some fighters of democracy that have received the heritage of utterly absolutist totalitarianism thinking from the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Also because the poison of the cultural revolution has infested their bodies, these fighters of democracy only talk about overthrowing and toppling and nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="41"> These ideas are the biggest obstacles to democracy, because these people do not understand that negotiations and concessions are the most important method on the road to realizing democracy. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>

<seg id="3"> This Spring Festival, the author was lucky to go to a mainland village for the Chinese New Year and visit some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While infected with the thick atmosphere of the New Year of China's villages, I was uneasy about the lake of cultural activities in the villages. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The author discovered in the village of a close friend and relative that in past years whenever this village celebrated Spring Festival, they would organize the villagers and put on a local play called "horse racing lantern," </seg>
<seg id="6"> This play uses characters from the Three Kingdoms period as its theme.  Adults and children can all play a part in the game and the villagers never get tired of it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This countryside has many troupes that performed "horse racing lantern," they would not only play in that village but also stroll to other villages; with these troupes coming and going, everything was quite lively. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But this year this village did not organize the play. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It turns out that just purchasing a costume for "horse racing lantern" costs a large amount of money.  In the past villagers would put together their money to buy costumes, and now these costumes are worn out to where they cannot be worn again. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The troupes went door to door asking villagers for a little money, but none of the folks were willing to give anything, and other villages of that countryside also had similar situations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Without "horse racing lantern," the village became cold and quiet all of a sudden; </seg>
<seg id="12"> adults began to play mahjong, </seg>
<seg id="13"> children began to play cards, </seg>
<seg id="14"> and all the villagers said this New Year was boring. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Setting off firecrackers and playing mahjong became the main scenes in the villages celebrating Chinese New Year. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The tendency of gambling is incessant despite repeated prohibitions, and tends to spread rampantly.  Seeing losses and wins reaching over 10,000 RMB has become a common thing, especially for the large number of farmers returning from jobs in away from the countryside,  they have become the main characters seen at gambling halls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The hard earned money from a year of work skips away so easily, </seg>
<seg id="18"> and family disputes brought about by gambling break out frequently; some even become tragedies with families falling apart or people dying. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some farmers say that they not only gamble during the Chinese New Year, but also participate in gambling when they are not farming; </seg>
<seg id="20"> if you don't gamble you have no place to go. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If you want to do some cultured activities in the village, finding "entertainment" is too hard; </seg>
<seg id="22"> not only does the village not have facilities and funds, there is no one to organize them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this aspect, there is no doubt that the practice of Jiangxi Province is a happy note for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses, Jiangxi's provincial government began to implement the "government puts out money, the market operates it, villages and towns build stages, and farmers watch plays" policy since last September. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Every year the government arranges at least 60 million RMB of special funds for the villages' cultural causes, sending excellent cultural products to the masses of the villages. </seg>
<seg id="26"> With the beginning of the Chinese New Year, the government put out another 40 million RMB, for a total of 100 million RMB of special funds to establish villages' cultural causes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The things that have been bought with this special funding are fairly substantial: </seg>
<seg id="28"> The fund invites various professional cultural and arts performance groups to carry out performances in villages no less than four times every year in every countryside and town. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It invites all levels of movie companies to organize groups to come to villages and show movies - at least six story films or documentaries every year in every administrative village. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It organizes and opens up cultural activities for the masses that have local characteristics - at least two to three times each year for every countryside and town. </seg>
<seg id="31"> From this "shopping list", it's not hard for us to see that the government is not just putting out a bit of money and that's it, but is making painstaking efforts to figure out how to use limited funding to give cultural feasts that exceed the expected values for the vast number of farmers . </seg>
<seg id="32"> At present, there is not one of the vast number of farmers who is not ecstatically happy about being exempt from the "state grain tax." </seg>
<seg id="33"> If all governments could be like Jiangxi's and "foot the bill" for cultural activities enriching the farmer masses, then this would be another joy for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This "joy" would not only allow farmers to escape the mahjong table and become involved in cultural activities, it would also add "bricks and tiles" to the construction of socialist new villages. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> peirongwangsohu@gmail.com </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Wang Peirong's child being kidnapped was a false alarm </seg>
<seg id="4"> At a little past 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child completely related the following: </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the morning of January 24, 2006 when Wang Peirong's child was making up for a missed physics class in Xuzhou's Number Three High School, the gate guard called her out of class. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The gate guard said to the child that three males of unclear identification had said to the gate guard that because her mother and father were on bad terms, the child, Wang Tianjiao, had not returned home for three days. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "At present her mother was missing, and we are the managers of her mother's working unit, and would like to go into the Number Three High School and take the child with us." </seg>
<seg id="8"> She said to the gate guard that what these three men said was totally untrue, and would not agree to go with them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With the help of the gate guard, the child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child gave her mother's manager a telephone call to ask him to confirm this.  That manager said he did not send people to Xuzhou's Number Three High School. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The child then called her father's manager. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When the child called her father's manager, </seg>
<seg id="13"> she said that there were three people that came to the Number Three High School to take her away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That manager asked: "Why didn't you go with them?" </seg>
<seg id="15"> She answered: "If I went with them I'd be dead." </seg>
<seg id="16"> After saying this the child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Listening to Wang Peirong's child relating this, one feels that the situation was serious and so Wang Peirong reported this to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On January 25, the feedback information from the police station was that what was related by Wang Peirong's child was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The police station asked the Chinese University of Mining's office of security if they sent people to the Number Three High School looking for Wang Peirong's child.  They answered they did not. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The police stations asked subordinate units of the Chinese University of Mining's office of security if they sent people to look for the child.  The answer once again was no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Relevant departments told Wang Peirong and her family to be careful of safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After this incident, leaders of relevant departments of Xuzhou were extremely concerned, </seg>
<seg id="23"> and through the detective department of Xuzhou's Ministry of Public Safety, they eliminated the likelihood of kidnapping the child. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked leaders of relevant departments of Xuzhou city and the detective department of Xuzhou's Ministry of Public Safety. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a false alarm, and the main reason for this false alarm was likely the gate guard of the Number Three High School. </seg>
