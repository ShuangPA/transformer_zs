bahraini princess marries us soldier, astonishing 5-year bond comes to end
the star-crossed marriage between bahraini princess meriam al-khalifa and us marine johnson was once extensively feted on us television. however, it has come to an end in the desert gambling town of las vegas after only five years.
meriam is a member of the gulf country bahrain's royal family. johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair, their fairy-tale marriage became the subject of a television movie.
but the las vegas review-journal reported that after only five years, the couple is headed to the court after meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions.
the pair met in 1999 when career military man johnson was stationed in bahrain.
but his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love.
their union was forbidden by the royal family, so johnson disguised meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap, forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to america.
after a bitter immigration battle with us authorities, the couple finally married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the famed and glitzy las vegas strip when johnson was 23 and the bride only 19.
however, johnson says that their star-crossed union comes to an end because of the temptations of the "sin city" of las vegas, the constant tensions with meriam's rich and powerful family and rumors of an assassination plot against him.
johnson says his work was to park the cars of hotel and casino guests while meriam was increasingly tempted by the nightlife of the gambling city, frequenting clubs late at night and ignoring her husband.
meriam abandoned her husband a year ago.
"she's gone off the deep end," johnson says.
this week's eurozone economic indicators to show continuous economic weakening in europe
economists said that eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while british data is expected to show a pick-up in industrial activities.
they said economic output data from the largest eurozone countries will continue to be volatile from one month to the next, but the longer-term trend of output will point to slowing economic growth.
the most important economic indicators of the week will be in germany, where the zew institute's economic expectations index, which is due on the 7th and is closely watched by the market, will offer europe its first evidence of economic confidence in december.
the zew index fell sharply to 13.9 in november from 31.3 the previous month.
economists said the significant appreciation of the euro will have continued to weigh on economic confidence in the latest survey, so there is no reason to expect any rebound in the economic expectations index.
"given that the main factors driving down economic confidence, including the euro's appreciation, uncertainty over global growth and the weak labor market and worsening unemployment in germany, have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the december survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely," bnp's economists said.
according to a survey among economists conducted by afx news, the afp financial news subsidiary, the index will drop again to 11.0 in december from 13.9 in the previous month.
however, teather of ubs investment bank said germany's zew economic expectations index could drop as far as zero in december.
"expectations of future german economic activity, as reflected in the zew survey of analysts and financial market participants, will continue to fall in our view," said teather.
ukraine crisis causing tensions between east and west to dominate osce meeting
russia has been accusing the west of interfering in the affairs of eastern europe, which has gradually become a focus due to the political crisis in ukraine and is expected to top the agenda of the annual ministerial meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce), which will open tomorrow.
russia is irritated by the creeping influence of the west into corners of europe it previously considered its backyard, like the baltic states, georgia and central asia. as a result, the recent incident in ukraine is likely to dominate the discussions of the two-day osce meeting in the bulgarian capital of sofia.
ukraine's supreme court has made a dramatic ruling to order a re-voting of the recent second-round presidential election. and before this, the european union had called on member states of the osce to ask their observers to get ready for "the quickest and efficient actions".
according to european sources, the number of osce observers will increase to 1,000 from the original 600 in ukraine's re-election scheduled for december 26th.
us secretary of state powell will attend osce's annual meeting, which is perhaps his last foreign tour before leaving office.
russian foreign minister lavrov, french foreign minister barnier, british foreign minister straw and german foreign minister fischer will also be attending the meeting.
the osce groups the 55 states of north america, europe and asia. it will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its founding next year.
the organization was established at the helsinki conference, which helped end the cold war.
bush's major test: intelligence reform bill to face congressional vote this week
the intelligence reform bill the us congress will take efforts to pass this week is part of an ambitious second-term agenda pushed by republican president bush, whose support level among republican congressmen will be his first major test after re-election.
in a newspaper interview yesterday, kean, the republican who led the investigation into the september 11, 2001 attacks on new york and washington, said the issue with the intelligence reform bill was that it has to be passed by the congress and that the matter itself augurs ill for bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda.
"congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and congress can't get these big issues taken care of, and then we're all in trouble," kean said.
"it'll be a long time before there's another bill with the support of the republican and democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80% of the american people in the polls," he told the new york daily news.
several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the groundbreaking reform bill could delay overhaul of america's antiquated spy network by months, years or kill it altogether.
the top democrat on the house of representatives' intelligence committee, harman, yesterday told cnn television that "if the bill isn't passed this week, it dies".
congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 before adjourning until early next year.
if lawmakers fail, the entire bill will be discarded and need to be rewritten in the congress' 2005 session.
ukraine's opposition strongly opposes large constitutional amendment to dilute presidential powers
ukraine's pro-west opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing ukrainian president kuchma before the second round presidential re-election.
the constitutional reform will dilute most of the president's powers.
with the november 21st vote declared invalid by the supreme court because of massive vote fraud in the second-round presidential elections and a new date of re-election set by the central election commission for december 26, opposition leader yushchenko is locked in a fresh standoff with kuchma.
"if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form, all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament. this would be unacceptable," said timoshenko, an ally of yushchenko.
"we want the president to be able to name the head of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor general so we can fight corruption and get rid of the clans that dominate ukraine's political and business life," she told reporters.
kuchma, who keeps close ties to russia, had pushed for constitutional changes before the re-election amid fears that the opposition could win the presidential election.
opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote for government-proposed constitutional changes and the parliament adjourned for 10 days.
according to the constitutional amendment, the power to appoint all top posts excepting the prime minister, defense and foreign ministers would be transferred from the president to the parliament, where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority.
according to the amendment, the president's nominees for the prime minister, defense and foreign ministers would need to be approved by lawmakers, who could also put forward their own candidates.
ukraine's political crisis enters third week with opposition calling for continuous protest
the chaos caused by ukraine's presidential election has entered its third week. opposition leader yushchenko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing president kuchma dismisses prime minister yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential reelection.
tens of thousands of yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital of kiev for two weeks, blocking the government buildings and encamping themselves on major avenues designed by soviet experts to hold military parades. the people power they have demonstrated has forced the supreme court to annul the second round of presidential election of december 21st and the central election commission to order a reelection for december 26th. the parliament has approved the dismissal of yanukovych, but kuchma, yanukovych's mentor, has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor.
yushchenko told supporters gathered at the capital's independence square this evening that kuchma should dismiss his government, and reshuffle the central election commission. in addition, both the parliament and kuchma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud.
"before these decisions are made, the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed," he said, starting his campaign for the december 26 election.
"over the past 14 days, the square has shown the love for ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of ukrainian people who can defend their own choice."
"we are undergoing a fight between good and evil. the world is applauding our victory and is proud of ukraine," he said.
as the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by moscow and yushchenko and kuchma are once again locked in a standoff of constitutional reform, polish president kwasniewski, lithuanian president adamkus and russian envoy gryszlov are scheduled to arrive in kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation.
egypt announces breakthrough in stalled middle east peace process
egypt says a new framework is expected to come into being for the middle east peace agreement.
it also says it is likely to return its ambassador to israel in the near future to restore the full diplomatic ties severed four years ago.
quoting "high-level" egyptian sources, egypt's state news agency, the middle east news agency (mena), said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation.
"an important understanding has been reached by egypt, israel, the palestinians and the significant international parties, such as the united states and the european union, agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict," mena said.
following the death last month of veteran palestinian leader arafat, the international community has revitalized its efforts to advance towards a final middle east peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between israel and palestine.
mena said officials expect that "preparations would take place until july, after which political action will begin".
mena said it will be followed by a conference in washington attended by all parties concerned with the peace process, notably israel and palestine, as well as egypt, the united states, russia and several european countries.
topics of the meeting are expected to include a "bilateral ceasefire" and the palestinian authority "putting a stop to anti-israeli attacks and consolidating its control over the situation in the gaza strip and the west bank."
for this point, mena said israeli prime minister sharon has promised to "stop israeli military operations against the palestinians insofar as they continue to respect the ceasefire deal and control their territory."
one billion children suffer from war, poverty and aids
the united nations children's fund (unicef) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children, half of the world's population of children, suffer from poverty, war and the scourge of aids.
unicef says the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child, are regularly imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms.
unicef executive director bellamy pointed out during the release of the report in london that "when half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emptied by aids, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood".
"too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood," bellamy added.
unicef has joined hands with researchers from britain's london school of economics and bristol university to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world.
researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter, 400 million have no access to safe water, 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million (mostly girls) have never been to school in the world.
researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of "severe deprivation", which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities.
the 10th annual unicef report released today points out that war and aids have destroyed networks that normally protect children and at times turned them into direct victims of war and aids.
eu resists chinese pressure to lift arms embargo
the european union today rebuffed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on china from chinese premier wen jiabao, but said it was working towards lifting the 15-year-old ban.
the eu dutch presidency made the remarks following a china-eu summit.
the netherlands says it cannot speculate how the eu will end the embargo.
the eu imposed the arms ban on beijing after the 1989 tiananmen square massacre.
although the arms embargo overshadowed the china-eu summit, the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements.
both china and the eu claim that such deals have strengthened their "strategic partnership".
"the eu side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo," said the eu in a joint statement made after the summit with chinese premier wen jiabao.
the statement points out that the chinese delegation "welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu."
wen jiabao didn't hide his displeasure at a press conference following the summit. he said the ban "does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu".
"the embargo is a result of the cold war and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between china and the eu," wen jiabao said.
a group of eu countries led by france is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted, saying the ban is outdated.
but some in the eu worry that without a strengthened set of eu rules, a lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales which could improve china's military strength.
"i have explained that the eu is willing to lift the embargo but i also must say that this is related to adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports," said dutch prime minister balkenende.
preliminary research finds folic acid may be linked to breast cancer but link not confirmed
a new health study points out that folic acid, a b vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects, has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.
but the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance, as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer, so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement.
folic acid, found naturally in dark, leafy vegetables, is known to be a key aid in the growth of the fetus.
researchers from the universities of bristol and aberdeen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960s were given supplements of either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folate, or a placebo, mostly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
the study published in the british medical journal says that by september 2002, breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five-milligram supplement as for those who took the placebo.
one of the researchers, ness, has stressed the results were merely "preliminary intended to point the way towards further research".
"it's entirely possible that this is a chance finding, so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions," he said.
ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements.
he says there is a "considerable difference between the trial" and current dosage recommendations.
according to british health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a 0.4-microgram daily supplement of folic acid, more than 10 times smaller than the doses given to women in the study.
two candidates in widely different mood as ukraine holds presidential re-election
the two rivals set to meet in ukraine's presidential re-election on the 26th this month have got ready for the runoff.
the pro-west opposition leader yushchenko is confident of wining the election while the pro-moscow incumbent prime minister yanukovych says he will no longer represent the "shameful" ruling party in the election.
meanwhile, russian president putin has changed his attitude towards ukraine's entry into the european union, saying he supports its entry into the eu.
asked how many votes he would garner in the re-election, yushchenko told a crowded press conference, "conservatively speaking, i should win around 60% of the votes."
on the other hand, yanukovych, looking anxious and upset from his appearance, directly dodged answering reporters' questions several times, saying at last, "for god's will, we will win."
yanukovych, who was originally chosen as a successor of incumbent president kuchma, has changed his mind and positioned himself as a rival candidate against both the opposition and the ruling parties.
"i used to trust those cowards and traitors working with the government but i'm very disappointed now. the government is shameful," he said almost directly giving the names.
kuchma and the opposition reached a compromise to transfer part of the presidential powers to the parliament by amending the law to end two weeks of massive opposition protests and political chaos since the presidential election on november 21st.
yanukovych's victory in the election has been declared invalid by the supreme court by reason of massive electoral frauds and a re-election must be held.
powell visits hague in final push for eu-us harmony in his term
us secretary of state powell today held talks with senior officials of the european union to make one last effort to push forward us-eu unity in his term.
powell's european tour is aimed at mending the diplomatic impairment between the two sides that has resulted from the iraqi war. hague is his last stop.
it will likely be powell's last official overseas trip in his term. the eu has promised him they will continue working to ease strained bilateral ties ahead of us president bush's february visit to europe.
however, differences between the two sides still linger.
"we have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground during the second term of president bush," said dutch foreign minister bot, whose country currently holds the eu's rotating presidency.
eu external relations commissioner ms. waldner says she believes europe and the united states have already made progress "to put the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind us", but she still acknowledges that it is a "key moment in the eu-us relationship" now.
bush will fly to brussels on february 22nd to meet with eu and nato leaders.
powell says bush's visit is aimed at mending the fissures caused by the iraq issue.
powell has visited sofia and brussels during this european trip but has only made limited progress in improving ties.
in brussels in particular, powell criticized six anti-war european nato members for hurting the "credibility and cohesion" of the alliance by refusing to attend the training exercises in iraq.
however, powell still firmly holds that his meetings have shown the us's commitment towards fully restoring diplomatic relations.
basescu elected romanian president, faces challenge of forming government
romania's opposition candidate basescu won a fierce presidential election today but the center-right mayor of bucharest is likely to face big challenges when forming a new government due to the large number of parties in a split parliament.
according to the final official results announced today by romania's central election commission, basescu, candidate of the "justice and truth alliance", had won 51.23% of the votes while his rival; prime minister nastase had won 48.77%.
nastase has conceded the defeat and expressed his congratulations to basescu.
outgoing president iliescu has also congratulated basescu.
nastase says his social democratic party will help basescu to enable romania's smooth entry into the european union.
the social democratic party won a victory in the parliamentary election of the 28th last month.
"today my priority is to form, as soon as possible, a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for romania to join the european union. romania must make efforts to satisfy the demands for the eu entry," basescu said in a press conference.
he stressed that the romanian people should know what cost would be paid for the integration. the nation must be united to ensure that there would not be voices suspecting the integration.
romania has completed negotiations on the eu entry and is expected to join the bloc in january of 2007.
basescu has also put the fight against poverty and corruption and ensuring legal independence as his priorities.
dispute over past work remains; oliver stone seeks peace with turkey
movie director oliver stone is in istanbul today promoting the new film "alexander" and hoping to repair an old rift with turkey.
his screenplay for the classic "midnight express" has been criticized for tarnishing the image of turkey.
"i never intended it to be against turkey. it was against injustice everywhere," he told afp in an exclusive interview.
public opinion in turkey has denounced stone since the first screening of the award-winning film in 1978.
the film was based on the memoirs of billy hayes.
hayes, a young american, was sentenced to 30 years in jail in turkey after a protracted legal saga that began when he was caught at istanbul airport trying to smuggle hashish out of the country.
critics in turkey have accused stone of willfully interpolating hayes' original book and writing a racist screenplay in which every turkish character, without exception, is depicted as a villain.
the film is also rife with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture.
stone has acknowledged that "perhaps some of the zealousness, some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much, too hard".
but he added, "it was true that hayes did get screwed in the turkish prison. he was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years and he was treated brutally in prison. so this is all documented."
"the larger picture is that turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not working properly. america has similar problems," stone said.
japan's economic growth likely to slow down next year
japan's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year.
while huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to japan this year after a decade of stagnation, analysts now pin their hopes on a booming china to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between japan and china.
the evidence is mounting that japan's economy could slump briefly in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a glut.
under a recently adopted new data methodology, japan's economy actually contracted slightly in the april-june quarter and grew only 0.1% in the july-september quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.
at present, economists still differ in their views about the robustness of japan's economic recovery.
according to estimates by bnp paribas researchers, japan's economy will record a 2.3% growth in real terms for both the current fiscal year ending in march next year and the fiscal year that follows.
they call 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the us economy is firmly on a recovery track and japanese consumer spending is taking up the slack for slower exports.
another relatively pessimistic view is from ufj institute economists who expect only 1.8% growth in the current fiscal year and an even slower 0.6% for the following fiscal year.
they have cited the "potential risk" that corporate profits have failed to lead to higher personal incomes.
french foreign minister: middle east peace process to test french-us ties
after a meeting with us secretary of state powell today, french foreign minister barnier said that resuming middle east peace talks would be a "test" of their trans-atlantic relationship.
following the death of palestinian leader arafat, france called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the israeli-palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between barnier and powell after their meeting.
barnier flew into washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with powell and his designated successor, national security adviser rice, before turning around and heading to brussels for a european union summit.
both paris and washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the us invasion of iraq last year, but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the middle east impasse.
"we want to improve future relations between france and america and europe and america," said barnier, after a short meeting with us secretary of state powell.
"i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between palestinians and israelis," he said.
barnier called early this week for an early international conference on the middle east to take advantage of what he termed a "window of opportunity" created after arafat's death last month.
but powell has not made any promise.
he said the two had spoken of a british plan to hold a meeting bringing in the palestinians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held.
us officials say they have made it their priority to promote the israeli-palestinian peace to ensure smooth palestinian elections next month.
the election will produce a leader who could rein in islamic militants and resume talks with israel.
foreign minister machimura proposes japan-south korea talks for next january
japan's foreign minister nobutaka machimura proposed today that japan and south korea hold talks on a free trade agreement (fta) as early as january next year.
jiji press reports that during a meeting with the south korean foreign and commercial minister, ban ki-moon, in the southern japanese city of ibusuki in kagoshima county, machimura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible, since both tokyo and seoul wish to conclude the fta by the end of 2005.
the talks between machimura and ban ki-moon followed the summit of the 17th between japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korean president roh moo-hyun, who urged tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against north korea.
prime minister koizumi is under great public pressure to punish north korea over its abductions of many japanese nationals during the cold war.
the families of kidnapping victims were outraged after japanese researchers concluded last week that pyongyang presented the remains of other people in a bid to prove that two kidnapped victims were dead.
apart from the abduction issue, koizumi and roh moo-hyun mutually agreed that the six-nation talks aimed at halting north korea's nuclear weapons development should resume as soon as possible.
since a standoff starting in october 2002 resulted from north korea's secret development of a nuclear weapons project, three rounds of six-party talks have taken place and ended without concrete results.
north korea has boycotted the fourth round of six-party talks scheduled for september this year.
members of the six-party talks include south korea, north korea, the united states, china, japan and russia.
thai prime minister thaksin still expected to win next february's election
thai prime minister thaksin is confident he will win a second four-year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarnished by a failure to quell a deadly separatist insurgency.
with national elections slated for february 6 next year, thaksin and his political adversaries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year.
a total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in thailand. the bird flu swept across much of asia but was particularly devastating in thailand, where the government admitted it had "made mistakes" in its handling of the epidemic.
however, the health concern is unlikely to unseat thaksin. instead, many are asking only how thorough his victory will be, and what will it mean for the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces.
"the phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at thaksin, he has managed to capture popularity for the time being," kraisak, chairman of the senate's committee on foreign affairs told the afp.
"but things will start to disintegrate next year, if you look at the accumulation of wealth (by his family and associates), the social injustices and the violence," he said.
it is because of social injustices and violence that chaos erupted in thailand's muslim-majority deep south, where a sporadic separatist insurgency occurred continuously starting in january.
since january this year, radical muslims have targeted buddhists, government officials and security forces in shootings. they also carried out bombing attacks and beheadings. more than 560 people have been killed and another 100 are reported missing so far.
palestinian cabinet secretary claims arafat poisoned about one year ago
late palestinian leader arafat's cabinet secretary abdelrahman reveals that arafat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his ramallah headquarters.
"something strange happened to arafat around a year ago. it was on september 25, 2003," abdelrahman told al-hayat newspaper.
"the president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vomit.
it was from that moment that the president's health started slowly deteriorating."
arafat died in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11.
some senior palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned.
however, french doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations.
two weeks before the delegation's call on arafat mentioned by abdelrahman, the israeli prime minister sharon's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove arafat, although without specifying by what means.
the israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for arafat, who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters.
"arafat shook hands with people, who had come to express solidarity with him in his confinement by israel," abdelrahman recalled.
on september 25th last year, arafat received two delegations, one group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission and another group of political activists.
"the last time arafat became ill, on october 12 this year, he had the same symptoms: vomiting, refusal to eat and all the symptoms of a flu," abdelrahman pointed out.
bush recognizes iraqi troop training needs to be improved and fully supports rumsfeld
us president bush admitted today that the iraqi army was not ready to replace us troops, and warned that the election scheduled to be held on january 30th next year would not be an end to serious violence in iraq.
during a one-hour press conference, bush also expressed his support for defense secretary rumsfeld, firmly believing that the pentagon chief would "fulfill his duty".
bush says that despite some occasional serious differences, he has pledged to continue cooperation with russian president putin, adding that it is the right time to move on a road leading to the end of conflict in the middle east.
he also believes that the best way to deal with the issues of iraq and north korea, existing members of the "axis of evil", is through multilateral diplomatic mediation.
continuous car bombing attacks yesterday shocked the iraqi shiite muslim's two holy cities of najaf and kabala, killing 66 people and injuring more than 200 others. bush has recognized that violence has made the iraqis pay a price but insists that the election in january will go ahead.
bush has warned the americans that the iraqi election "is only the beginning of the political process". he also warns "we certainly don't expect a smooth process."
bush has also admitted that the training results of iraqi security forces are a mixed bag.
"sometimes, when there is fierce fighting, they (iraqi troops) will run away," he said.
he says such iraqi troops can never protect the national security, which is unacceptable.
but he believes that after being trained for a long time by the us army, iraqi forces will achieve good training results.
white house: iraqi rebels' attempts to sabotage election doomed to failure
in response to rebels' attack at noon today on a restaurant in a us military base in iraq's major northern city of mosul, which has killed 22 and wounded over 60 others, white house spokesman mcclellan said that as the iraqi election is coming nearer, terrorist activities by iraqi rebels will become more rampant but such "enemies of freedom" will surely be eliminated.
reports from iraq say that a large explosion occurred in a military base restaurant during lunchtime causing heavy casualties among the us soldiers.
the iraqi interim government is scheduled to hold the first election since the overthrow of the hussein regime on january 30th.
the united states has dispatched nearly 20,000 more troops to ensure the security of the iraqi election.
the total number of us troops during the election will reach 150,000.
mcclellan says the nearer the election is, the more terrorist attacks rebels loyal to hussein will launch in an attempt to undermine the interim government. they want to turn back to the past but "they will be defeated and they are being defeated".
as for a recent poll that shows about 56% of the american people believing the war in iraq is "not worth fighting", 57% disapproving of bush's handling of the iraq situation and 52% believing defense secretary rumsfeld should resign, mcclellan says president bush has never been one to govern based on polls.
"polls are snapshots in time, and we are working to continue to build upon the progress being made in iraq."
mourners attend funeral of philippine political figure poe
a large number of filipino fans attended today's funeral for this country's most renowned movie star, poe. the event was held under tight security amid fears of unrest.
sixty-five-year-old poe was a defeated presidential candidate.
mourners accompanied poe's coffin as it was pulled through the streets of the capital manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses.
many riot police were deployed near malacanang palace because of concern that poe's supporters could erupt into violence.
these people have accused president arroyo of rigging the presidential election on may 10th.
the army has also raised an alert, as intelligence had pointed out a coup was to have taken place to replace arroyo with poe's widow roces.
however, the funeral and burial went off peacefully. movie fans chanted poe's initials fpj and waved presidential campaign posters used by him.
poe died on december 14th after suffering a stroke.
crying women and children showered the coffin with flowers as the hearse's procession wound its way to the cemetery.
malacanang palace, close to the route of the procession, was barricaded with huge shipping containers as justice secretary gonzales warned that some parties could use the funeral to stir up trouble.
gonzales said a "credible intelligence report" indicated that there was a conspiracy by some people to use the funeral march and burial to incite the people to turn against the government.
but army spokesman colonel pascual said the coup plot obviously fizzled out after the military deployed troops to guard important areas.
arroyo went out of malacanang palace later to greet the soldiers and police who guarded the premises.
armitage warns syria to cooperate with us on iraq and lebanon issues
us deputy secretary of state armitage warned syria today, saying the development of future ties between damascus and washington rests on whether syria is willing to cooperate with the us on the issues of iraq and lebanon.
armitage was again putting more pressure on syria in an interviewed by arab reporters.
the state department made the interview public earlier.
"i certainly hope the ties will be improved but this depends on how al-assad's (syrian president) group will do," armitage said when asked if he expects continuous tense relations between the us and syria.
the number two figure of the us state department pointed out that damascus should implement resolution 1559 adopted in september this year by the un security council to stop all interfering actions in the neighboring country of lebanon as soon as possible.
armitage said what syria is doing "doesn't go against the us but rather the whole international community".
asked if the us will bring the question of syria's refusal of cooperation into discussion when the un security council discusses next january whether un peace-keeping forces will remain in lebanon or not, armitage replied, "we are most likely to do that."
talking about the iraqi issue, armitage recognized that damascus has indeed taken some actions in line with the us expectations, such as strengthening joint border patrols with iraq to cut off rebel's funding.
however, he pointed out that syria "needs to make greater efforts".
ait and ccnaa sign lease for new ait building site in neihu today
the american institute in taiwan (ait) and the coordination council for north american affairs (ccnaa) today signed a lease for land in neihu for construction of ait's new office building. director of ait taipei office, douglas paal, says that the new building is currently being designed and hopes that construction can be completed at an early date so that ait can operate in a safe, secure and modern environment.
douglas paal and john chen, director general of ccnaa, signed a 99-year lease for land in the taipei grand hyatt hotel at noontime, on which ait plans to build a new office building.
signing as witnesses in the ceremony were ait taipei office deputy director david j. keegan and ccnaa deputy director general jacqueline liu. foreign minister mark chen was also in attendance.
ait was established by the taiwan relations act to manage the unofficial relations of the united states with the people of taiwan. it has offices in taipei and kaohsiung.
douglas paal said in a speech that it had been at least over ten years since ait began to work with ccnaa and the taipei city government to locate a plot of land for a new ait facility.
he said that the current facility on hsin yi road is a bit old and shabby-looking, and has literally run out of space.
for ait, the transition from the current facility to the new office building will be a challenge. it will allow ait to consolidate all of its operations, currently scattered throughout taipei, into one centralized location and operate in a safe, secure, and modern environment.
he said that he design of the new building is underway and he hopes that the new facility will add beauty to taiwan and become a source of pride for all of taipei.
once the design plan is completed, ait will invite bids for a construction contract and construction will begin after the contractor has been decided. construction is expected to begin within the next few years.
ait spokesman dana smith said that the building is estimated to cost a total of around us$160 million to develop, including land rent and architectural design. many factors must be taken into account on whether it can be completed by 2008. he hopes construction work will start as soon as possible.
thousands of worshippers head to bethlehem for christmas midnight mass
thousands of worshippers are gathering in bethlehem in the west bank for the christmas midnight mass.
meanwhile, the palestinian liberation organization (plo)'s mainstream fatah movement looks likely to defeat hamas in yesterday's palestinian local election.
in violent conflicts, israeli troops and palestinian gunmen were engaged in a gunfight in gaza, leaving three palestinian young men killed.
israeli settlers blockaded a major road to protest a mortar attack on the settlement area.
plo leader abbas had also been allowed to go to the west bank town of bethlehem, which is the first time in the past four years israeli authorities have allowed a senior palestinian leader to attend christmas celebrations.
late plo leader arafat was a regular guest at midnight mass in bethlehem after his return to the palestinian territories in 1994 but he had been unable to attend since being confined to his headquarters in ramallah by the israeli army in early december 2001.
the latin patriarch of jerusalem sabbah is set to begin his traditional procession shortly after midday today to bethlehem's manger square where thousands of christians and muslims have already been gathering.
sabbah is scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at a midnight mass at the church of the nativity.
before the midday, manger square had been full of pilgrims with balloons of santa claus. they passed in and out of the church of the nativity. a christmas tree outside of the church has been decorated with various lights and ornaments.
the israeli authority has specially eased travel restrictions to enable christians from the gaza strip, the west bank and israel to go to bethlehem for the midnight mass.
putin claims purchase of major assets of yukos to protect national interest
russian president putin pointed out today that russia's takeover of the major assets of russian oil giant yukos was to protect the national interest. it was also the first move of re-nationalization in the post soviet era.
talking about the takeover by the russian state oil company of yuganskneftegaz oil and gas company, yukos' subsidiary company, at a year-end press conference in the kremlin, putin said, "russia is using an absolutely legitimate market mechanism to protect the national interest.
i think the move is absolutely normal."
the russian state oil company won the bid of yuganskneftegaz's baikal finance group in a secret auction before the takeover and became the new owner of yuganskneftegaz oil and gas company today.
the russian state oil company made a sudden announcement just before last midnight that it had acquired 100% ownership share of the previously little-known baikal finance group.
the acquisition has enabled the kremlin to take a firm grip on russia's crucial energy industry.
the russian authority has been attacking yukos and khodorkovsky, its billionaire founder over the past 18 months.
the russian state oil company is merging with the russian state gas company. altogether with yuganskneftegaz oil and gas company, the three will control 1/5 of russia's oil production and all its natural gas production to become the world's largest energy group.
putin has defended the purchase move by attacking the behind-the-scene privatization process of the 1990s.
the then privatization measures had enabled russian economy's most valuable assets to fall in hands of a small number of shrewd businessmen such as khodorkovsky.
baikal finance group previously offered $9.35 billion in a bid to win control of yuganskneftegaz oil and gas company.
yushchenko declares himself victor in ukrainian presidential election
with preliminary election results showing opposition leader yushchenko leading his rival, incumbent prime minister yanukovych, in the presidential revote, and yushchenko having declared himself victor, supporters of yushchenko held another gathering at the independence square today in the city center of kiev to celebrate the victory.
"this is a clean political victory," fifty-year-old yushchenko told the mass assembled at the square.
"this is an elegant victory. the people have demonstrated their power. the ukrainian people have bravely risen up to resist what is probably the most unreasonable authority in eastern european countries. today, the ukrainian nation and the ukrainian people have won," he said.
"for 14 years, we were independent, but we were not free," he said.
"today ukraine has entered a new political era," yushchenko added.
"the era of (outgoing president) kuchma, (kuchma's predecessor) kravchuk, and (incumbent prime minister) yanukovych has become history."
according to the votes counted in over half of the constituencies released by ukraine's central election commission, opposition leader yushchenko has taken a 16-point lead over incumbent prime minister yanukovych in the historic presidential election re-voting.
ukraine's central election commission says that the pro-west yushchenko has won 56.33% of the votes while the pro-moscow yanukovych has won 39.86%.
the results are based on the polling results of 50.96% of polling stations across ukraine.
there are more than 33,000 polling stations in ukraine.
an earlier exit poll also shows yushchenko taking a 15 to 20-point lead over yanukovych.
japan's ministry of internal affairs and communications to launch telecommuting trial to reduce office life pressures
japan's ministry of internal affairs and communications today launched an advanced internet program, hoping that 20% of the japanese workforce could "telecommute" through the program before 2010 to reduce pressures from office life and resolve the problem of family splits.
an official from the ministry of internal affairs and communications says there are currently about 4 million japanese, or 6% of japan's total workforce of 63.2 million, working outside offices through scientific and technological means.
starting from january, six officials from the ministry of internal affairs and communications will not need to enter the office for at least one day a week, instead using high-speed internet service to perform their work duties from their homes, universities or libraries.
the ministry of internal affairs and communications will expand the scope of the program based on feedbacks to increase the number of telecommuting employees working at home to 20% of its 2,500-strong workforce.
a ministry official says the program, which enables employees to use chat rooms and teleconferencing, is expected to "improve workplace efficiency".
he says telecommuting can offer employees more time to be with their family members and enable people supporting the family to do more housework.
he says the program can also ease the problems of traffic congestion, including a lessening of exhaust gas and less overcrowding of vehicles during rush hours.
he says the aim of the program is to "encourage the sharing of telecommuting technology with private firms", to raise the ratio of telecommuters to 10% by 2005 and 20% by 2010.
pentagon launches unprecedented relief effort for asian tsunami victims
the pentagon said today that it had launched one of the largest relief operations in its history to help asian tsunami victims. the operation consists of two aircraft carrier strike groups, 20 reconnaissance and supply planes and tens of thousands of personnel.
pentagon spokesman, navy major hicks, said that after the tsunami of the 26th, which has killed over 80,000 people, the us military has been facing the challenge of launching operations in several regions at the same time.
"it is one of pentagon's largest humanitarian relief operations," he told afp.
major general conway, who is in charge of military operations for the joint chiefs of staff, said they are seeking to evaluate the scale of the disaster and have sent assessment teams to thailand, sri lanka and indonesia.
the pentagon says it has dispatched 20 aircrafts to southeast asia, including six c-130 cargo aircrafts carrying drinking water and food, five kc-135 refueling aircrafts and nine p3 reconnaissance aircrafts.
the pentagon has also mobilized the uss lincoln and uss richard aircraft carriers and their warships.
conway says the uss lincoln strike group and its 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel have departed hong kong for the gulf of thailand and will be deployed off sumatra.
the uss richard with 25 helicopters, 2,100 marines and 1,400 crew aboard has left guam and is expected to arrive in the bay of bengal on january 7th next year.
the pentagon has decided to mobilize another 5 ships in guam and 2 ships in the indian ocean base of diego garcia with freshwater-producing capability.
conway says thailand's utapao base in the gulf of thailand will serve as a command base for us military relief operations.
nightclub fire in argentine capital kills at least 169 wounds 375
city officials in the argentine capital of buenos aires said today that at least 169 people had been killed and 375 injured in a fire at a buenos aires nightclub on the night of the 30th.
the nightclub was packed with some 2,000 teenagers celebrating the end of the academic year when the fire occurred.
the city's health secretary stein pointed out that the casualty toll was provisional.
"this is a disaster. this is a disaster," argentine interior minister fernandez told reporters outside the smoldering nightclub, saying the death toll was provisional.
stein pointed out that at least 375 people were injured in the blaze, including 18 police officers.
stein said the fire broke out before midnight on the 30th at this disco club in the city center, where some 2,000 youngsters were attending a rock concert inside the ballroom.
buenos aires mayor ibarra said that according to unconfirmed reports, the blaze started when somebody tossed a flare during the concert.
"this is a terrible night," ibarra told todo noticias television.
bodies were lined up on the street as firefighters attempted to put out the blaze.
a chaotic scene unfolded outside the blazing discotheque early today, as hundreds of police and firefighters mingled with stunned teenagers and their parents searching frantically for their children.
un: relief materials could take weeks to reach tsunami victims in aceh
the united nations said today that desperately needed relief supplies would take "weeks" to reach tsunami survivors in isolated areas of indonesia's aceh province.
us navy helicopters arrived in banda aceh, the capital of aceh province, while more and more field hospitals were being put into operation in the city. an enormous amount of relief supplies have been arriving at the airport in succession.
but the chief of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia, elmquist, told reporters that a myriad of coordination and infrastructure problems was making it impossible to quickly deliver aid.
"it's going to take weeks before we send relief materials to all the isolated areas," elmquist told reporters by telephone from the capital jakarta after returning from banda aceh.
"it's a concern and we are desperately doing what we can to find ways of establishing distribution systems in banda aceh," he said
the un and other relief organizations have warned that people in the devastated region of indonesia's sumatra may die within days if they do not have immediate access to clean water, food and medical treatment.
asked if the delay was effectively a death sentence for some tsunami survivors, elmquist replied, "i hope not. i hope that people are finding ways to get food and water, but obviously it's not a situation we are happy about."
"it's a very serious situation and we can only hope that it's possible to do something quicker," he said.
japan offers us$500m for relief, topping world in funds
japan today promised us$500 million to countries devastated by the indian ocean tsunamis. japan's contribution by far outpledges all the other countries racing to help victims of one of the world's worst disasters, increasing the money the world has promised for relief and reconstruction to more than us$1.6 billion.
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said in a statement that as asia's largest economy, japan would consider more assistance including money and technology.
"japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways: financial resources, knowledge and expertise, and human resources," he said.
"for the time being, japan will extend to affected countries and relevant international organizations up to us$500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the disaster," he said.
koizumi also said he would take part in a meeting of world leaders on the 6th in the indonesian capital jakarta to discuss aid for the tsunami-hit countries.
the us government increased its promised aid nearly ten-fold to us$350 million yesterday after us president bush was accused of being slow to respond to the massive human disaster.
china, which is seen as increasingly challenging japan for influence in asia, has promised us$60.5 million, a major sum for a developing nation.
"japan will make further contributions by utilizing fire-department helicopters and personnel," koizumi said.
"japan will also consider, as early as possible, additional contributions including mobilizing japan's self defense forces' aircrafts, vessels and personnel."
japan had earlier pledged us$30 million to the tsunami-hit countries.
a foreign ministry spokesman said that the amount was included in koizumi's 500 million dollar pledge.
who: 50 aid groups to offer medical assistance in indonesia's aceh province
the world health organization (who) said today that 50 aid groups had arrived in indonesia's aceh province to provide medical care for survivors of the tsunami disaster.
the who's indonesian representative, petersen, said the who was trying to coordinate all the groups and had held a meeting with them in the afternoon.
petersen said coordination was proving difficult because many groups had gone directly into aceh for relief work.
"we are trying to sort it out, everyone has just come in, but everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate," petersen said by telephone from jakarta.
petersen reiterated that the who's main concern was to prevent the outbreak of diseases such as cholera and dysentery, which have the potential to kill tens of thousands of people.
"we are very worried since we have a very large number of people displaced who don't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies," petersen said.
"so we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks."
however, petersen stressed that there has been no sign yet of any major problems with the diseases.
indonesia's health ministry says up to 100,000 people in sumatra may have been killed in the tsunami disaster, with most of the victims in aceh province.
as most of the medical facilities have been destroyed in aceh province, the indonesian military and the governments of singapore and australia have set up at least 8 field hospitals in the past week. the united nations children's fund has also begun delivering basic medical kits intended to help 200,000 children.
powell predicts shiite victory in iraqi election
us secretary of state colin powell today predicted a shiite victory in the iraqi elections but he also assuaged concerns it could bolster iranian influence inside the country because of the past feud between iraqi and iranian shias.
there are growing indications that sunni arabs will either boycott the january 30th election or will be prevented from taking part in it by the iraqi authority due to a spreading insurgency.
"the new government and the transitional national assembly that will come into place will be majority shiite," said powell on nbc's "meet the press".
"the majority of the iraqi population is also shiite."
shiite muslims make up more than 60% of iraq's population, and are concentrated mostly in the southern and central parts of the country.
sunni arabs, who live in central and western provinces, comprise about 20% of all iraqis.
former iraqi foreign minister pachachi, who now heads the sunni-dominated iraqi independent democrats party, today called for the vote to be delayed but powell said the iraqi election would be held on schedule.
powell also said he felt it was unlikely shiite control of iraq's future government would mean it would be run from iran.
"my sensing right now is that, even though there may be iranian influence - and iranians will try to influence iraq's political situation, but there is sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shias," he said.
international aid pours in but time not on tsunami victims' side
foreign rescue troops are airdropping food and setting up clean water supplies in asia's tsunami-hit areas to help millions of victims left homeless and hungry.
statistics show the death toll has reached nearly 150,000.
donations are flooding in from various governments while us president bush has put his father, george bush, and his predecessor, clinton, in charge of efforts to raise private aid.
a us delegation led by secretary of state powell arrived in thailand last night to express us concern and assess the progress of the relief work ahead of a crisis summit on the 6th in the indonesian capital of jakarta.
powell's delegation includes president bush's younger brother, florida governor jeb bush, and us agency for international development administrator natsios.
powell will head the delegation to inspect the disaster in thailand, indonesia and sri lanka before attending the summit on the 6th.
powell said the mission of the visit was to assess the situation "and see what else the us might need to do", but he was carrying no new immediate promise of aid beyond the 350 million dollars already committed.
since the disaster occurred, there is a voice now to give up the search for thousands of tourists still unaccounted for, many of them foreign tourists.
however, thai prime minister thaksin has vowed that the hunt will go on in his country.
"we will continue to use our best efforts as foreign experts have told me that they (the missing) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests. so we will not stop searching," thaksin told reporters in phuket island.
an unprecedented international relief effort is underway.
a fleet of us navy helicopters from the us aircraft carrier lincoln dropped aid and picked up survivors for a second day in aceh of indonesia.
rear admiral crowder, commander of the lincoln, says that 50,000 pounds of food and water have so far been delivered to the disaster-hit areas and the operation is "going great".
tsunami relief efforts mask backstage political wrestling
with asian tsunami relief materials flooding into disaster-hit areas, behind-the-scene activities are also underway with governments wrestling over who should offer and receive the aid and who should play a leading role in the largest relief operation in modern history.
the tragedy, which has killed nearly 150,000 people, has rekindled past flames of war, including the differences between the united states, the united nations and europe as well as the struggle for the leading role in asia.
however, relief experts still hold cautious hopes that given the many countries that have been hit by the tsunami, the tragedy on a global scale may set a precedent for countries that have promised aid to indeed keep their commitments.
"aid commitments by governments have never been 100% fulfilled in time," said international development professor juma of harvard university's kennedy school of government.
governments have already pledged aid of us$2 billion. prominent figures in the international political arena including us secretary of state powell and un secretary general annan as well as the leaders of australia, china and japan will hold a crisis summit with deep political implications on the 6th in the indonesian capital of jakarta.
us president bush increased us aid nearly ten-fold to us$350 million after being accused of being slow in response and following senior un relief official egeland's open criticism of rich countries' "stinginess".
in asia, the tsunami has resulted in a behind-the-scene wrestle over regional influence. increasingly confident china has promised to offer aid worth us$60.5 million, a major sum for a developing nation.
japan, which has been reducing its foreign aid for six consecutive years, has shattered remarks that the country's power is declining with rapid action; promising to provide at least us$500 million, a sum which far outshines other nations.
world leaders tour sri lanka to assess tsunami damage
sri lankan officials say that world leaders including un secretary general annan and us secretary of state powell are successively arriving in sri lanka to gain a first-hand view of the tsunami damage that killed 30,600 people here last month.
they say powell has already arrived and south korean prime minister lee hae-chan is due around noon.
the us embassy said in a statement that powell is to visit some of the areas worst hit by the december 26 tsunami, including the southern region of galle where us marines are to be based for relief operations.
the south korean embassy said in a statement that lee hae-chan would tour the west coast accompanied by the sri lankan prime minister.
"together with sri lanka's prime minister rajapakse, the korean prime minister will travel along the western coast to have a firsthand view of the destruction of lives, livelihoods and property caused by the tsunami," the statement said.
lee hae-chan will stop over in hambantota, the worst affected area, to oversee relief operations being carried out by private and non-governmental organizations from south korea.
un secretary general annan is expected to start a two-day visit in the evening.
"he will be touring along with world bank president wolfhensohn to some of the affected regions in the south and the east," said un spokesman samarsinghe.
world health organization director general lee jong-wook will also arrive in colombo today.
german foreign minister fischer is due in sri lanka by the weekend.
sri lankan officials say many other world leaders are expected to come over the next few weeks.
these leaders include canadian prime minister martin. canada announced yesterday that martin would visit sri lanka and thailand later this month.
bush: us set to boost peace efforts after palestinian election
us president bush said today he was "deeply heartened" by a strong turnout in today's palestinian elections and promised that the us would bolster its peace efforts.
"palestinians throughout the west bank and gaza took a key step toward building a democratic future by electing a new chairman of the self-rule government," president bush said in a statement.
"observers of the election have described the election as free and fair."
"this is a historic day for the palestinian people and for the people of the middle east," he said.
exit polls show former prime minister abbas has won the election by a huge margin, winning two-thirds of the votes cast.
he will succeed arafat as chairman of the palestinian self-rule government.
"these efforts, including today's presidential elections and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months, are essential for the establishment of a sovereign, independent, democratic and peaceful palestinian state, a new state that can ensure the security of israel," bush said
he said the us government looked forward to cooperating with the newly elected palestinian self-rule government chairman and the palestinian people to advance the cause of middle east peace.
peace in the middle east is consistent with the wishes of the peoples of both israel and palestine for peaceful and secure coexistence.
bush has also urged israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the west bank and gaza.
he added that arab states must "jointly take concrete steps with all concerned parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace, offer financial support to the palestinian people, and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists".
annan's plan to visit rebel controlled regions in sri lanka blocked
un secretary general annan said today he wanted to return to sri lanka someday to "see all parts of the country".
annan ended a two-day tour of tsunami-battered parts of sri lanka amid reports the sri lankan government had blocked him from visiting rebel-held northern areas.
asked at a press conference whether the sri lankan government had blocked him from traveling to zones held by the rebel liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), as widely reported in several national newspapers, annan said, "i'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process."
annan said president kumaratunga had personally objected to his on-site visit in guerrilla-held territory, fearing the rebels would make political capital out of his visit.
"i raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the peace efforts," he said.
"i have also discussed that with president kumaratunga."
the abandoned visit of annan to rebel-held regions has resulted in the indignation of residents of the rebel-controlled northern city of jaffna. hundreds of people staged a protest outside the un office in jaffna.
however, the sri lankan government has firmly rejected the media reports, saying they are "misleading."
on the other hand, as the relief work is in its full swing, sri lanka's weather forecasting authority has warned that sri lanka's costal lines are likely to be hit by a typhoon currently being formed in coastal waters.
russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes sickness among children
the british weekly science journal nature reports that highly toxic rocket fuel, spewed out during launches of spacecrafts at russia's space base in baikonur, kazakhstan, is causing serious illness among children living nearby. but the russian space agency has denied the claim today.
the science journal nature report published today quotes a study as saying that levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents in the polluted areas are twice the regional average.
the study was conducted by a team of russian scientists led by epidemiologist zykov.
the russian space agency responded by saying that "no direct influence of space-related activities on the population's health has so far been established".
the study quoted by nature focused on children in the altai republic.
the altai republic is located in a mountainous region on the southern fringes of siberia.
the altai republic was chosen as the study's target because of pollution from unburned fuel, notably hydrazine.
hydrazine is used to power the early stages of some russian launchers.
zykov compared the health records of about 1,000 children in two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with health records of 3,300 children from a nearby unpolluted control group.
nature reports zykov has concluded that children in the currently worst-affected areas are up to twice as likely to need medical attention during this time, and need to be treated twice as long.
white house says iraqi election will be flawed
the white house acknowledged today that iraqi elections set for january 30th are "not going to be perfect". meanwhile, two car bombings in iraq's mosul today killed at least two iraqi soldiers.
asked if he agreed with iraqi prime minister allawi 's statement that violence would make voting impossible in some areas of iraq, white house spokesman mcclellan said, "we all recognize that the election is not going to be perfect."
"this is the first time iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders. it's for a transitional government, and it's one of three elections that will take place this year," he said.
"so we're going to do everything we can to help the iraqi people and the interim government to ensure as broad a participation as possible in this upcoming election," mcclellan said.
a bloody insurgency erupted in iraq on the 11th, which caused the deaths of at least 25 people with 6 killed in a car bombing attack in former president hussein's hometown of tikrit. as a result, iraqi prime minister allawi acknowledged that some parts of iraq would not be able to take part in this month's election.
meanwhile, two more bombing attacks occurred in the iraq city of mosul today, killing at least two iraqi soldiers.
us army sergeant schaeffer told afp that a truck exploded when trying to attack a joint convoy of us and iraqi military vehicles, killing an unknown number of civilians.
schaeffer said a second car parked on the other side of the street exploded and killed two iraqi soldiers.
us trade deficit reaches record high of us$60 billion in november
the us commerce department announced today that us exports sank 2.3% last november, driving the trade deficit to a record high of us$60.3 billion.
us exports fell to a five-month low of us$95.6 billion while us imports rose 1.3% to a record us$155.8 billion as the orders for imported oil increased over 2 billion dollars, up 1.3%, to a record us$14.2 billion.
the trade gap rose 7.7% from last october's revised us$56 billion and a huge 50.8% from november 2003's us$40 billion.
according to a survey conducted by cbs' marketwatch, wall street economists had expected the trade deficit on goods and services to shrink to around us$53.3 billion.
the us trade deficit is still growing despite a weakening dollar, which has made us goods cheaper at home and abroad.
today's report from the commerce department will put pressure on the dollar and renew calls for washington to do something about us energy independence and the trade imbalance between the us and china.
the decline of us exports last november was caused by a us$1.4-billion drop in capital goods, including us$325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines.
exports of industrial materials, mainly energy, fell by us$800 million.
exports of autos, consumer goods and food also declined.
japanese defense chief: never forget militaristic history, respect neighboring nations' dignity
the director general of japan's defense agency, yoshinori ono, said today that even with japan's high profile in the world, it would not forget its militarist history and would keep in mind neighboring asian countries' "dignity".
asked about concerns likely to rise upon japan sending its self defense forces (sdf) to the tsunami-hit areas of south asia, ono said, "when we have contacts with southeast asian countries, we should never forget the past."
he told reporters, "we must establish a kind of relationship whereby we can tell our friendly neighbors that we are friendly.
when looking back at the past, we should fully respect other countries' dignity."
ono specifically talked about this year as marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. "we hope we can be reborn and cooperate with the new era," he said.
ono has just concluded a tour of several tsunami-hit south asian countries. he said that when the indonesian leader told him that the relief operation by japan's sdf should come to an end no later than the end of march, he felt the "dignity" of an independent nation.
the un has expressed its concern over the time limit for foreign troops set by the indonesian government.
foreign troops have been widely praised for offering aid to the most remote tsunami survivors.
nearly 1,000 japanese sdf soldiers are heading to countries that were hit by the tsunami on december 26th. the death toll of the disaster has exceeded 163,000.
this is the largest deployment operation of japan's sdf since the end of the second world war.
japan's constitution imposed by the united states after the war renounces the use of force by the sdf.
political interference in nhk program? war of words erupts in japanese media
allegations that the public-owned japan broadcasting corp. (nhk) had been pressured by politicians several years ago to soft-pedal a program on japan's legacy of sexual enslavement during world war ii have pitted liberal japanese media against their conservative counterparts.
liberal japanese media have attacked nhk for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of japan's wartime conduct and victims of sex slavery, allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders.
but conservative newspapers have defended nhk's editing of the program, saying that nhk executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objectiveness of their programs.
the controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex slavery of comfort women in the japanese military during the war.
the trial, held by a women's rights group in tokyo in december 2000, found the late emperor hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women during japan's occupation of asian nations.
historians say at least 200,000 young women, mostly korean but also from taiwan, china, the philippines and indonesia, were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline japanese army brothels during the war.
the program's chief producer satoru nagai held a tearful news conference on the 13th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior nhk officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling liberal democratic party, shinzo abe and shoichi nakagawa, who expressed concerns over the program.
nagai said top nhk officials then re-edited and shortened the program.
"nhk bowed to political pressure," he said.
abe and nakagawa admitted meeting with nhk officials and telling them to be "fair" but strongly denied pressuring the broadcaster.
eurozone indicators show core inflation under control
economists said today that eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation still remains under control.
meanwhile, eurozone industrial output and french consumer spending are both expected to decline.
when the european union's statistics service releases inflation figures on the 20th this month, they are expected to confirm that inflation will rise slightly to 2.3% in december from 2.2% in november.
but the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases, and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%.
core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer prices figures.
economists point out that core inflation, which excludes food, energy, tobacco and alcohol prices, has remained at a 1.6-2% range for the past two years.
european central bank president trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have diminished recently.
while inflation will remain above 2% in the coming months, it is likely to fall below this level by the end of the year.
meanwhile, another economist says a weak number is expected to be released for the eurozone's november industrial output on the 18th, given recent evidence of weak growth in germany.
german output declined 1.7% in november and economists polled by afp's financial news subsidiary afx news expect eurozone output to fall 0.4% in november following the 0.5% drop recorded in october.
schmieding of the bank of america says a rebound in eurozone output is likely in december.
bureaucracy hits tsunami refugees twice
three weeks after the strongest tsunami in history, surviving refugees are fighting with bureaucracy and political domination while the world's attention has already been distracted to other places.
with thousands of decaying corpses gradually unearthed from the rubble, the death toll of the december 26th tsunami disaster has exceeded 168,000. meanwhile, the upcoming iraqi election and president bush's inauguration will replace the tsunami disaster to become the world media's headline news.
indonesia has backtracked on a demand that foreign troops engaged in humanitarian relief operations will withdraw within 3 months.
in thailand, leaders of canada, sweden, norway and finland are discussing the reconstruction project and efforts to identify the dead.
however, survivors are facing new difficulties. for instance, the deep-rooted bureaucracy in indonesia has hindered the delivery of relief materials pouring in from around the world.
"we are like persons who do not exist. we have been hit hard by the disaster, lost everything and are famished," said busriadi, a fisherman from a little fishing village in aceh province's capital, banda aceh, on indonesia's sumatra island.
he asked, "where are the food, clothes and other relief pouring into aceh as we have seen on television?"
busriadi, like thousands of other refugees, lost his identity cards and other official documents in the tsunami, making his quest for aid a nightmare.
despite begging officials for help and daily hurrying back and forth going through formalities, the results have always been the same: no aid.
zeng qinghong reportedly paid visit to zhao ziyang before the latter's death
the hong kong-based china information center for human rights and democracy says vice president zeng qinghong paid a visit to zhao ziyang, the purged former general secretary of the communist party of china (cpc), before he died early this morning in a hospital.
the information center has cited zhao ziyang's family members as saying zeng qinghong visited him at 6:00am in a beijing hospital, about one hour before he died at the age of 85.
zhao ziyang served as cpc general secretary and premier, but was ousted for opposing the use of military force to suppress the 1989 democratic movement at tiananmen square. he has since been under house arrest and regarded as an unpopular figure by the government.
the information center has cited zhao's family members as saying the incumbent premier wen jiabao, who used to work for zhao ziyang, had not paid a visit to him when he was seriously ill.
however, before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th, tian jiyun, a retired member of the cpc central committee and his former assistant, visited him.
the china information center for human rights and democracy has been in contact with zhao's family and for years has been releasing accurate news about zhao ziyang at appropriate time.
the information center said some 20 retired senior party, government and military officials planned to write an open letter to the cpc, calling for a reappraisal of zhao ziyang's contributions and an open memorial service for him.
the information center also said that zhao ziyang's family will not be allowed to hold or prepare for a funeral, and relevant arrangements will be finally decided by the party.
zhao ziyang's wife, liang boqi, is 86 now.
the information center said that due to concerns about her health, she had still not been informed about her husband's death as of this evening.
zhao ziyang passes away, china urged to move toward democratization
after the former leader of the communist party of china (cpc), zhao ziyang, died of illness today, world figures have highly praised him while japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi, the taiwan government and overseas democratic movement activists have all called on beijing to carry out zhao ziyang's ideas of democratic reform.
zhao ziyang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at tiananmen square. he was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a beijing hospital at the age of 85.
jiji press reported japanese prime minister koizumi as saying, while mourning for zhao ziyang, that, "i hope they (china) are committed to democratization."
taiwan has also appealed to china to carry out political and democratic reform after zhao ziyang's death.
chinese overseas democracy movement activists have praised zhao ziyang as "one of china's greatest reformers", who sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the democracy movement at tiananmen square.
"during his suffering under house arrest for 15 years, he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards a government of law and democracy," said lian shengde, once a student movement leader and now president of the new york-based free china movement.
"zhao ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle."
some democracy movement activists have requested the chinese government hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and give fair appraisal to his achievements.
however, they have acknowledged that zhao ziyang will not be offered such courteous service, as the chinese government fears that people who are disgruntled with the communist rule will make use of this opportunity to make disturbances.
the 1989 student democratic movement was prompted just by the death of reformist party leader hu yaobang.
xinhua news agency reported briefly today that comrade zhao ziyang died in beijing due to illness, which was the only official announcement on the matter.
un: rich countries fail to fulfill commitment to reduce poor population
a un appointed expert panel says in a new report that rich countries have so far failed to fulfill their commitments when they promised to offer aid to reduce half of the world's extremely poor population by 2015.
the world's rich countries had promised to take part in the ambitious un "new millennium development goal" program in order to improve the fate of the world's poor and suffering.
however, over 1 billion people in the world live on less than one us dollar and some 2.7 billion people live on less than two us dollars every day. un experts say there is almost no time left for rich countries to fulfill their commitments.
"with the right mobilization of resources and political will, and reform in developing as well as in developed countries, these goals are still achievable," said brown, head of the un development program.
un experts say the world's 22 rich nations have promised to offer 0.7% of their gross domestic product (gdp) to aid developing countries but they are now providing only 0.25%.
un secretary general annan has commissioned former harvard economist sachs to lead a team of development experts to prepare this report on the progress of the goals, which includes extreme poverty elimination, achieving universal elementary education, child mortality reduction and the fight against aids and other deadly diseases.
"in fact, the ways to practically resolve the problems already exist, the political structures have been set up and the costs are affordable for the first time. what is needed now is action," the report says.
un announces establishment of global disaster warning system
the united nations has announced it will set up a global disaster warning system to predict large natural disasters.
however, differences remain over which country's technology will be used in the disaster warning system in the wake of the south asian tsunami tragedy.
several un agencies said in a joint statement after a global conference in kobe, japan, that un experts would create a global disaster system to reduce the damage resulting from large natural disasters.
the large disaster caused by the south asian tsunami has outraged indian ocean nations.
"the new program will bring peace and security to mankind," said briceno, director of the international strategy for disaster reduction.
"an effective early warning system can protect the lives and safety of millions of people around the world."
but the un statement is largely symbolic.
officials of the un educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) say more important discussions will be held on the disaster warning system.
the unesco is leading the effort to set up a global disaster warning system.
"several countries have raised their proposals now so we need to do the work of coordination," said bernal, head of unesco's intergovernmental oceanographic commission.
bernal says the commission will hold two meetings within 60 days, in hopes of picking one of the countries' tsunami warning systems.
one meeting will be held in paris and the other has yet to be determined.
bernal hopes that a decision can be finalized in july. the global disaster warning system will be completed and be running by mid-2006, which is also the target date set by the unesco.
beijing hiv positive cases rise by 40% annually
xinhua news agency report of december 1st from beijing (by staff reporters zhao xinpei and li xu) - beijing's municipal health bureau recently released the latest figures on hiv carriers in beijing. between 1985 and october 2004, a total of 2,046 hiv carriers were reported, with an average annual increase of 40.6%.
according to national aids statistics, beijing ranks 8th nationwide in the number of hiv positive cases reported.
the 2046 confirmed hiv carriers included 403 beijing residents, 1,507 migrants, 106 foreign nationals and 30 people with an unclear address.
analysis shows that most of beijing residents' aids cases are related to intravenous drug use and through sex activities. migrants' aids cases are mainly related to intravenous drug use and through blood adoption and donation while foreigners' cases are mainly related to sex activities.

the municipal public health bureau has selected ditan and you'an hospitals as two designated hospitals in beijing to offer free treatment for aids patients and be responsible for the clinical services of such free treatment. the municipal health and the municipal finance bureaus are responsible for uniformly organizing purchases of the medicines and test kits needed in the treatment.
beijing's municipal education commission has reviewed and adopted a policy offering free education to children of hiv carriers and aids patients as well as an educational policy for students living with hiv/aids.
currently, hospitals of grade two or above and with departments of gynaecology and obstetrics are responsible for offering free aids consultations and screening. ditan and you'an hospitals have been selected to offer anti-virus treatment for pregnant women.
so far, 1,390 condom vending machines have been installed free of charge in some districts. methadone treatment has been promoted among intravenous drug users and a clean needle exchange trial program has also been launched.
shanghai tops world in power generation equipment output and capacity
xinhua news agency report of december 1st from shanghai (by staff reporter jiang wei) - following the test run of a 660-mw power generation unit, shanghai steam turbine generator co., ltd attached to the shanghai electric and power station group on the 1st reached its target for an annual production of power generation units with a total capacity of 15,000 mw ahead of schedule. this enables shanghai to top the world in terms of both the production of power station equipment and production capacity, thus fulfilling the long-cherished wishes of several generations of people working in china's equipment manufacturing sector.
shanghai electric and power station group is china's largest power station equipment manufacturing base.
over the past several years, due to the rapidly rising demand for power generation equipment in china, power generator manufacturers entered a stage of high growth and great development.
shanghai electric and power station group has combined its advantageous reserve of turbine generator and power station boiler equipment to win via public bidding the order for manufacturing nine units of heavy-duty gas turbine generators and 3 exhaust heat boilers after contracting for four 1000-mw thermal power generation units.
meanwhile, the integration of operations has further improved the firm's management, technological development and production efficiency.
currently, shanghai electric and power station group holds a 40% market share in china's power station equipment sector and is continuing to expand its overseas markets in regions such as the middle east, southeast asia and south america.
in this year alone, shanghai steam turbine company has won contracts for power generator's main engine parts worth 6 billion yuan.
the president of shanghai electric and power station group, zheng jianhua said that this summer's "power shortage" had resulted in sharply rising demand for power station equipment and that the power station equipment market had seen increasingly fierce competition.
the group is working towards the three big targets of "developing 1000-mw thermal power generating units and gas turbine-generating units as well as 1000-mw nuclear power generating units" so as to become one of the world's top 500 at an early date.
(hong kong, macao and taiwan) hong kong observatory offers new services to world meteorological organization's websites
xinhua news agency report of december 2nd from hong kong - starting on the 2nd, the hong kong observatory (hko) will offer two new services to the world meteorological organization's websites, the "world weather information service" and the "severe weather information center".
a spokesman for the observatory says the two services will offer official weather observations of global cloud cover and rainfall to the "world weather information service" website and a 7-day review of tropical cyclone movement to the "severe weather information center" website.
the two services follow hko's provision of official observation data on worldwide heavy rain (including heavy snow) which was offered to the "severe weather information center" website at the beginning of the year.
sources say the "world weather information service" website has been offering official weather forecasts and monthly average climatological data for major cities around the world.
the new service offers official weather observations around the world for the first time, with maps of global cloud cover and rainfall as its primary service items.
the new web pages will cover a wide range of detailed weather observation data with 8 regular updates each day.
the new product for the "severe weather information center" website is a review function of tropical cyclone movement routes.
it was so designed originally that the website would not keep such information as a tropical cyclone's previous locations after it had disappeared.
however, it has often been the case that the public still want to obtain the relevant data about the tropical cyclone several days after its landing.
to serve this purpose, the new product saves the tropical cyclone's grades, locations and movement routes for the past 7 days so that the public and the media could still obtain needed data about a tropical cyclone several days after its landing and disappearance.
world's first bird flu virus h5n1 rapid diagnostic kits successfully developed in shantou
xinhua news agency report of december 3rd from shantou (by staff reporters zhang yiwen and lin junqiang) - sources from the shantou university medical college and the medical school of the university of hong kong's joint influenza research center say that they have developed the world's first bird flu virus h5n1 rapid diagnostic kits after six months of cooperation with xiamen university.
the rapid diagnostic kits can detect bird flu infections in a suspect's sample as fast as within one hour.
professor guan yi, director of the shantou university medical college and the medical school of the university of hong kong's joint influenza research center, says that current data shows that the death rate of the deadly infectious bird flu virus is much higher than that of the sars virus.
previous tests used to take three to five days to ascertain infection and sometimes more than a week.
the successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technology employs the methods of elisa and gold agglutination tests to examine such samples as nasal or throat secretions and chicken embryo culture for whole or split viruses and blood serum to confirm any infection with the bird flu virus as quickly as within 1 hour or no more than 2 hours.
the new technique is simple, convenient, and easy to apply on the spot in epidemic-stricken areas. it is 90% accurate and helpful for early discovery, diagnosis, isolation and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent the wide spread of the epidemic and large-scale disaster.
upon the invitation of the china disease prevention and control center, shantou university medical college and the medical school of the university of hong kong's joint influenza research center recently held a training course on bird flu diagnostic techniques, including the latest bird flu rapid diagnostic technique, for personnel from the disease prevention and control centers of 20 provinces and cities across the country.
spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs commission in hong kong expresses strong displeasure with remarks by hyde, chairman of the us house international relations committee
xinhua news agency report of december 3rd from hong kong - a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs commission in hong kong expressed strong displeasure on the 3rd with recent remarks made by hyde, chairman of the international relations committee of the us house of representatives, in hong kong.
the spokesman said the speech in hong kong on the 2nd by mr. hyde, chairman of the us house of representatives' international relations committee, was a malicious attack on china's development and progress as well as a slander on china's foreign policy evidencing a cold war mentality, with which we are strongly unsatisfied.
the spokesman noted that it is known to all the world that china's development is not only in the fundamental interests of the 1.3 billion chinese people but also beneficial to the world's prosperity and development.
in the international political arena, china is a responsible country and has been playing an active and constructive role in safeguarding the world's peace and stability.
on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, china has always strictly abided by relevant international conventions, firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form, and insisted on solving such issues through negotiations, talks and the strengthening of international supervision.
the spokesman points out that it is regrettable that mr. hyde has turned a blind eye to the facts and made such extremely irresponsible remarks as sino-us relations are witnessing a healthy and stable development, which completely runs counter to the common grounds on the development of bilateral ties reached recently by heads of states of china and the us, goes against the mainstream voice in us asking to strengthen the cooperative relations with china, and is certainly harmful to the development of sino-us relations.
china's largest seawater desalination project to be kicked off in zhoushan
xinhua news agency report of december 6th from hangzhou (by pan yifeng and xu qun) - china's largest seawater desalination project in the mainland so far, with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons, is to be kicked off in the putuo district of zhoushan city in zhejiang province.
for residents in zhoushan long accustomed to water shortages, the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes.
according to relevant authorities, a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the hangzhou development center of water treatment technology under the state oceanic administration and the liuheng township government of zhoushan city.
the project costs 50 million yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water. it is presently the largest seawater desalination project in the mainland. the first-stage of construction is expected to be completed next year.
zhoushan is one of chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage.
the entire city consists of 1,390 islands. the per capita fresh water is 601 cubic meters, which equals to only 25.4% of the per capita average in zhejiang province. the problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city.
taking liuheng township in putuo district as an example, some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 yuan per ton.
the technique of seawater desalination by reverse osmosis, developed by the hangzhou development center of water treatment technology under the state oceanic administration, is a process of membrane separation through the driving force of pressure, which at present is a focal point for current global seawater desalination research.
according to the persons in charge from the center, both the cost and the energy consumption level of the seawater desalination by reverse osmosis project have been lowered through technological improvement and equipment modifications at home.
the cost of seawater desalination per ton has further been lowered from the original 5 yuan.
this indicates that the cost of seawater desalination is expected to approach that of tap water and industrial water.
(international) results of hungarian referendum on the 5th invalidated
xinhua news agency report of december 5th from budapest (by staff reporter liu weimin) - a national referendum was held on the 5th in hungary on issues regarding the privatization of the country's hospitals and public health-care institutions and the granting of dual citizenship to ethnic hungarians living outside the country.

under hungary's relevant laws, a referendum result is valid only if the number of people taking part in the vote is more than 50% of the total number of voters across the nation or if the number of votes for or against the above questions exceed 25% of the total number of voters across the nation.
before the vote, the hungarian government and the ruling party had been calling on voters to vote against the two questions while opposition parties called on voters to support them.
sources say that voter turnout for this referendum was the lowest ever, counting both referendums and elections.
following the release of the polling results, hungarian prime minister gyurcsany made a speech recognizing the failure of the referendum.
he said that the government would take more active steps to draw up policies towards nationalities and carry out health care reform.
the chairman of hungary's largest opposition party, the alliance of young democrats, orban, said that although the voters did not reach the required number, the referendum was helpful nevertheless.
he called on the government and the parliament to take into account the referendum results when drawing up relevant laws.

three gorges project's underground powerhouse to begin construction
xinhua news agency report of december 8th from wuhan (by staff reporter shi yongfeng) - the principal part of the underground powerhouse of the three gorges project began inviting bids for the first time on december 8th, which preludes the construction of the three gorges underground power plant.
the three gorges project design calls for installation of 26 700-mw water turbo generator units with an installation capacity of 18,200 mw. after their full operation, the units will generate an annual average of 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours.
to further tap its power generation potential, the three gorges project has reserved a location for the construction of an underground power station in its preliminary design.
according to the chief from the china yangtze river three gorges project development corporation, the three gorges underground power station is located in mountains to the right side of the three gorges dam. major structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main plant buildings, tailrace systems, bus shafts, and a 500-kv transformer substation.
six 700-mw power generation units will be installed in the underground power station.
as a result, the total number of generating units in three gorges project will increase from 26 to 32 and the installed capacity will increase from 18,200 mw to 22,400 mw, dramatically improving the power generation capability of the three gorges project.
flood prevention is a top priority in the construction of the three gorges project.
according to the operation and control plan of the three gorges reservoir, the water level of the three gorges reservoir will need to be lowered from its normal level of 175 meters to the flood prevention level of 145 meters before the start of flooding season each year.
as a result, the construction of the underground power station will raise the water exploitation index of the three gorges reservoir, reducing abandonment of water, increasing power generation capacity and maximizing the station's non-flood peak adjustment period when abandonment of water is not necessary.
at present, the preparatory projects such as the excavation and construction work of the underground power station's tributary canals, tailrace canals and supporting structures have already begun.
sources say the underground power station will be fully completed and operational at the end of 2008.

mbeki announced at the end of his visit that parties in the ivory coast had reached a consensus on a 4-point proposal.
the proposal includes the completion of relevant legislation required by "the marcoussis peace accord", the commencement of a process to disarm the conflicting military personnel, and the return of all ministers to fulfill their duties, and the restoration of domestic security.
the chairmen of the ivory coast's parties and groups in the parliament had decided at a recent meeting that the parliament would review the drafts of constitutional amendments starting from the 10th.
rebels in the ivory coast announced on the 8th that rebel leaders would hold a meeting to evaluate the general peace process and discuss the disarmament issue.
a coup followed by a civil war took place in the ivory coast in september 2002.
last january and this july, the major parties in the ivory coast and rebel representatives reached agreements in france and ghana respectively, agreeing to restore peace and realize national reconciliation.
however, implementation of the deals has witnessed ups and downs, resulting in continuous setbacks in the peace process.
the rebel group that controls the northern part of the country recalled its representatives in the government in mid-october, plunging the peace process into a stalemate once again.
the situation in the ivory coast further deteriorated after a serious clash between ivorian government forces and french troops in the country in early november.

experts propose introducing news spokesman system for minors in china
xinhua news agency report of december 13th from shanghai (by reporter liu dan) - "the china youth social education forum --- 2004 media and the development of minors", which ended on the 13th in shanghai, has proposed that china should introduce a spokesman system in respect of the status of minors to regularly release news on the current development and existing problems of minors.
a recent poll conducted by the relevant organizations in shanghai showed that minors spend an average of 1.17, 1.05 and 0.99 hours each day on extracurricular books, tv and the internet. about half of their after-school time is spent on the media, which, as a brand-new social force, has become a factor that can't be neglected in minors' growth and development.
"media is a window that connects the youths hearts and the outside world. when the window is opened, fresh air comes in. so do flies and mosquitoes",
chen tianqiao, president, shanghai shanda networking (group) co., ltd. said.
while the media may offer beneficial conditions for the healthy development of minors, due to the needs of market competition and economic benefits as well as a lack of quality with some media people, the viewpoints in published articles may easily mislead minors in their thinking and values. even worse is the dissemination of violence and pornography in some media.
at present, there are more than 2,000 tv channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies with 1,868 radio programs. the number of domestic internet users has reached 87 million.
officials of the forum say that the establishment of a spokesman system for minors will offer authoritative investigation data on the current development and problems of young people and change the current "false voices" of the media to create a healthy and favorable environment of public opinions for minors' development.

there will be a time limit for the existence of the coalition forces. under un resolutions, it will end after iraq completes the political process and a legitimate government comes into being.
zebari stressed that the new iraq would maintain its islamic character and abide by the charters of the arab league.
the iraqi people are facing a historical opportunity to rebuild the country on a new basis and iraq will witness its rejuvenation to become an important part in the arab world that can contribute to all its people.

(international) un warns of rise in global drug-related deaths in 2005
xinhua new agency report of december 17th from vienna (by staff reporter song guocheng) - the executive director of the un office of drug control and crime prevention, costa, warned in a press statement on the 17th that due to the production increase of heroin in afghanistan, the world's black market price of heroin was expected to stabilize with a concurrent increase in drug purity, which is expected to result in more deaths of drug users.
costa has issued warnings to health and anti-drug officials in europe and its neighboring countries, calling on them to pay attention to the latest trends in afghanistan's drug cultivation and in international drug-related crimes, and calling on them to take appropriate preventive measures.
according to statistics by the vienna-based un office of drug control and crime prevention, heroin production in afghanistan dropped by 94% in 2001 when opium plantation was forbidden in the country. in the following year, heroin's degree of purity in europe's black market decreased by 50%.
between 2000 and 2002, drug-related deaths in europe dropped by 20%.
costa says that compared with 2003, the plantation area of opium in afghanistan has increased by 64% this year with heroin's production reaching up to 500 tons; higher than the global black market's one-year trade volume. the trend indicates that the degree of drug purity in the world will rise and drug-related deaths will increase accordingly.
costa says the drug source in afghanistan is posing a "clear and real threat" to the world's anti-drug efforts. the increase of heroin supply in the black market means the "death verdict" for drug users.
it is estimated that around 100,000 people die in the world each year from drug overuse.

domain names are the basis of communications on which all internet sites use for e-business, e-government, and other applications. at present, they are widely used as internet addresses.
people wishing to visit websites or send or receive emails must first enter a domain name.  the information transfer is then realized through the domain name system's analysis service which switches the domain name to an ip address to reach the website's servers.

the national top-level domain name server operated and managed by the china internet information center processes more than 380 million domain name analysis requests each day, with an average of over 4,400 requests per second and more than 8,000 at peak times.
facing the fast development of the internet, the china internet information center, the regulatory body in china for registration of domain names, has reevaluated 4 original national top-level nodes for domain names and redeployed its top-level nodes for dot-cn domain names based on such assessment.
in accordance with its internet development level and the software and hardware conditions of the user units, shanghai has been selected as the location for installing the national top-level node for domain names.
sources say there are 45,000 dot-cn domain names in shanghai so far, with internet prevalence reaching 26.6% and both it's internet prevalence and application levels leading the country.
there are 130,000 more dot-cn domain names and 230,000 websites in the eastern china regions neighboring shanghai, with an advanced development level.
as a result, shanghai has been chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan.
china becomes world's largest hard alloy producer
xinhua news agency report of december 22nd from nanchang (by staff reporters yang yuanyuan and li xingwen) - china's hard alloy industry has seen rapid development over the past several years with annual output now exceeding 1/3 of the world's total. in terms of scale and output, china has become the largest hard alloy producer in the world, having a large variety of hard alloy products and the ability to produce most of them.
this was learned on the 22nd by the reporters from the ongoing china ganzhou tungsten industry development strategy seminar.
hard alloy is called "industrial teeth". due to its high hardness and durability, it is used for cutting tools, high-tension tools as well as for mining and road-building machinery. the development of the hard alloy industry plays a key role in the development of the whole tungsten industry.
sources say that china's hard alloy sector started from scratch in the 1950s and has continued its development, winning outstanding achievements in the process.
in the early 1980s, the world's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons while china's annual output was around 5,000 tons. since the beginning of the 21st century, the world's annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while china's output has rapidly reached 15,000 tons, accounting for more than 1/3 of the world's total.
marked progress has also been made in china's hard alloy exports.
in 1986, china's hard alloy exports were only 100 tons but in 2003, exports reached 2,500 tons. this year exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for 1/3 of the world's hard alloy market trade, a share similar to that of its output. the foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports has increased to $70 million annually from under $4 million in the past.
adb offers loan to support shanxi's use of coalbed and coalmine methane for power generation
xinhua news agency report of december 23rd from beijing (by staff reporter jiang guocheng) - sources from the china representative office of the asian development bank (adb) said on the 23rd that the adb has recently approved a $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern shanxi province, which will generate power by utilizing methane produced in coal mining.
the coalbed methane development demonstration project will utilize the latest technologies to boost coalbed and coalmine methane production to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant to be built soon.
according to the project plan, it will offer at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed methane annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial and commercial consumers after its completion in 2008.
some 410,000 people in the jincheng area will benefit.
shanxi's coal production accounts for around 1/3 of the nation's total.
the total cost of the project is estimated at $237 million, with the japan bank for international cooperation offering a loan of $20 million and china construction bank offering a loan of $37.86 million.
the jincheng municipal government and two of the local mining/industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling $61.24 million.
the us trade and development agency has also provided a $500,000 grant.
methane captured from surface well while drilling an underground coal mine is called coalbed methane while methane generated from underground coalmining operations is called coalmine methane.
methane is highly explosive and needs to be drained before mining operations to ensure safe working conditions.
removal, capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help ease global warming and climate changes.
methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
using methane to replace coal can also increase the use of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and result in cleaner air.
hassing, an adb principal project specialist, says the project is expected to result in some 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emission reductions.
(international) israel museum's most precious possession is fake
xinhua news agency report of december 24th from jerusalem - director of the israel museum, james snyder, said on the 24th that an ivory pomegranate, a most precious possession of the museum, had been recently confirmed as a fake.
the ivory pomegranate was once thought to be the only relic discovered so far of king solomon time's first temple.
snyder said in a statement that the israeli authority had conducted a careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate.
experts have found that it is a cultural relic dating to the bronze period, much earlier than the first temple period of the jewish people.
the hebrew inscription on the pomegranate reads: "belonging to the temple of lord jehovah, holy to the priests."
however, the inscription has been confirmed to have been carved to it later.
the ivory pomegranate was bought from an anonymous collector by the israel museum for $550,000 in the 1980s.
archaeologist and antique experts believe that it was a treasure inlaid on the top of a scepter by a priest of the first temple.
snyder says the ivory pomegranate was identified as authentic by israeli experts including archaeologist nahman avigad before its purchase.
israel's haaretz reports that avigad authenticated the antique carelessly only with a magnifying glass.
the claim has been rejected by avigad himself.
over the past several months, israeli police has uncovered three large-scale cases of antique forgery successively and summoned hundreds of people for interrogation.
police and the antiquities authority unexpectedly found the ivory pomegranate was fake during the investigation.
police will indict some of the people involved in the case next week.
the jewish king of solomon built the first temple on the holy hill in the 10th century bc to enshrine holy items such as the ark of the covenant and noah's ark, which were later destroyed.
shenzhen to enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some office buildings and residential quarters
xinhua news agency report of december 26th from guangzhou - as a major step in building a "water-saving" city, shenzhen will enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings and residential quarters. at present, relevant design specifications and regulations for the "reclaimed water" are being drafted.
"reclaimed water" refers to municipal and living wastewater which, after being treated, can reach a certain water standard whereby it can be reused to some extent as undrinkable water.
its quality is between that of tap water and drainage water.
"reclaimed water" is generally and extensively used for flushing toilets, gardening and farm irrigation, cleaning roads, car washes, city fountains and supply water for cooling equipment.
an survey by the shenzhen water board shows that more than 70 buildings had "reclaimed water" collection systems in shenzhen in the mid-1990s. however, due to technology, design and management problems, all the systems were left unused as a result of the excessively high cost of utilizing "reclaimed water".
only an additional investment of some 300,000 to 400,000 yuan is needed to install "reclaimed water" processing systems in order to bring these pipelines back to work.
it is estimated that if all the existing 70 "reclaimed water" systems were put into operation, 35,000 tons of tap water would be saved in shenzhen each day, based on an average 500 tons of "reclaimed water" to be consumed daily by each residential quarter.
sources say shenzhen's "reclaimed water" collection work will begin with the renovation of the more than 70 buildings with the original "reclaimed water" systems. it will be further popularized based on the experience from the test-run.
meanwhile, shenzhen's water resources authorities will join hands with the urban planning and municipal departments to map out "reclaimed water" design specifications and enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings.
the treated "reclaimed water" will first be used in city greenbelt irrigation.

(international) auctioned assets of yuganskneftegaz not to be included in gazprom
xinhua news agency report of december 30th from moscow (by staff reporter song shiyi) - the director of the russian presidential office and chairman of the russian natural gas industrial corporation (gazprom), medvedev, told the press on the 30th that gazprom would merge the russian oil company (rosneft) as scheduled in january but yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary company of the yukos oil company purchased by rosneft, would not be included in gazprom's assets.
in another report, when talking about the reason why auctioned assets of yuganskneftegaz would not be included in the assets of gazprom, russian industry and energy minister khristenko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share-holder of the russian oil and natural gas industrial corporation and the nation didn't want to increase its overwhelming share.
he said yuganskneftegaz's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company.
on the 19th this month, the russian federal asset foundation held a public auction to sell 76.79% of the shares of yuganskneftegaz, yukos oil company's largest subsidiary company. the newly formed baikal finance group won the bid with $9.35 billion.
on the 22nd, the state-owned rosneft announced it had purchased baikal finance group, which won the bid for yuganskneftegaz's shares, to become the new shareholder of yuganskneftegaz.
analysts say one of the important reasons for russia's maneuver of the auction of yuganskneftegaz's assets is to position itself in a leading position in relevant legal disputes.
in september this year, russian president putin approved gazprom's merger of rosneft.
gazprom was founded in february 1993 and is the world's largest company in natural gas exploration.
the company holds 65% of russia's natural gas reserves.
last year, the company's gas output accounted for 93% of that in russia and 20% in the world.

according to authoritative sources from the fishing industry in chennai, the capital of tamil nadu state, the unexpected disaster has had a great impact on the state's fishing industry.

officials from the chennai fishing industry association said on the 31st during interview by xinhua that even if the fishing boats are repaired, fishermen dare not go out to sea in the next few months as they have seen with their own eyes the sea's rampage and ferocity.
some have lost their loved ones and some have suffered economic losses. their psychological fears will remain for a fairly long time.
it is estimated that the state's fishery output in 2005 will decline by 30% as compared with that of 2004.
during the tsunami on the 26th, most of the coastal fishing villages in tamil nadu state were affected, becoming the most seriously hit area in india.
by the 30th, the state has recorded a death toll of 6,230, most of them being fishermen.
sources say some 680,000 people were affected by the tsunami with 85% of them engaged in the fishing industry.

(hong kong, macao and taiwan) hong kong to see economic growth of approximately 6% in 2005
xinhua news agency report of january 11th from hong kong (by staff reporter su xiao) - the apec study center at the university of hong kong (hku) on 11th expressed its optimism about the world's economic environment this year, with an expected economic growth of 6% in hong kong and a 4.4% growth in the first quarter of this year on an annual basis.
speaking at the "hong kong macroeconomic forecast" press conference, the director of the hku apec study center, richard y.c. wong, said despite an expected rise of the interest rate, hong kong's major trading partners' slow economic growth and the economic growth of 3.6% and 8.5% in the us and the chinese mainland respectively, the global economic environment still holds good prospects for 2005.
he said the center predicted that hong kong's economic growth would remain at approximately 6% while the consumer prices would rise 3% at the end of the year.
the reshuffling of the labor market will remain slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to approximately 6.3% at the end of the year.
the uncertainty resulting from the fluctuation of global oil prices remains the main uncertain factor in hong kong's economy.
the executive director of the center, alan k.f. siu, said the economic growth momentum is expected to be moderate in the first quarter of the year, with the total local output increasing by 4.4%. the slowdown reflects a weakening in external demand, as hong kong's major trading partners are growing slower than expected.
according to the report, hong kong's real gdp growth is estimated to be a very robust 8% in 2004, with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5% and deflation finally contained in the third quarter of last year.
chow yei-ching, chairman of the steering committee of the hong kong macroeconomic forecast said the hong kong economy saw a robust growth in 2004, which reflected the sound fundamentals of the local economy. the foreign trade sector was very competitive and was able to capitalize on the strong and fast economic growth last year in the rest of the world and the mainland. the defeat of deflation would enable businesses to enjoy stronger cash flows.

bahraini princess married us soldier, astonishing 5-year marriage comes to end
the marriage between bahraini princess meriam al-khalifa and johnson, a us marine, was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by us television stations.  the star-crossed marriage, however, lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of las vegas.
meriam is a member of the gulf state of bahrain's royal family.  johnson risked his military career for this forbidden love.  their marriage, resembling a fairy tale, was once the theme of a tv drama.
however, as reported by the las vegas review-journal, five years have scarcely passed when the two confronted each other in court as meriam filed with the court for divorce in las vegas, where quick marriages but even quicker divorces are granted.
the pair met in 1999 when johnson was still a career military man stationed in bahrain.
after he met this little princess who is still in her teens, both fell in love with each other, which changed his life tremendously.
since their union was forbidden by the royal family, johnson disguised meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers, then sneaked her out of her motherland and brought her to the united states.
after a bitter immigration lawsuit with us authorities, the young couple finally got married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the las vegas strip known for its dazzling grandeur when johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19.
however, johnson said that due to temptations in las vegas, otherwise known as a "sin city," his constant tensions with meriam's rich and powerful family, and rumors of an assassination plot at his life, this star-crossed marriage eventually failed to survive.
johnson said he made a living by valet parking for guests of hotels and casinos, while meriam gradually indulged herself to the nightlife in the gambling city, frequenting nightclubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband.
meriam deserted her husband a year ago.
johnson said: "she has degraded herself to the bottom."
eurozone economic indicators this week will show continued weakening of economy in europe
economists said that eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output.  meanwhile, british data are expected to show an increase in industrial activities.
they said that economic output data from the largest country in eurozone will continue to show dramatic monthly fluctuations, but the long-term trend in economic output will show a slow-down of economic growth.
the most important economic indicator this week will be in germany.  the zew institute's economic expectations index, closely watched by the market and scheduled to be released on the 7th, will provide the first proof of economic confidence in europe for december.
the zew index dropped sharply to 13.9 in november from 31.3 in the previous month.
economists said, as the significant appreciation of the euro will continue to impact the economic confidence in the recent survey, there is no reason to expect any rebound in economic expectations index.
bnp economists said: "considering that major factors driving down economic confidence, including the appreciation of the euro, the uncertainty of global economy and the deteriorating employment rate in the job market in germany, are all burdens on the future growth expectations for the december survey period, a strong rebound in expectations index will be unlikely."
according to the survey of economists conducted by afx news, afp's financial news subsidiary, this index will again slip to 11 in december from 13.9 in the previous month.
but teather of ubs investment bank said the german zew economic expectations index could even drop as low as zero in december.
teather said: "in our opinion, expectations of future german economic activities will continue to slip as reflected in the zew survey of analysts and financial market participants."
triggering tensions between east and west, crisis in ukraine will become an osce topic
russia's repeated allegation about western interference in eastern european affairs has drawn increasing attention due to the political crisis in ukraine and will surely become the major topic at the annual osce ministerial meeting to be held tomorrow.
western power has gradually penetrated into some corners of europe originally considered by russia as its backyard, such as the baltic states, georgia and central asia.  this has long displeased russia.  as a result, the recent incident in ukraine will likely become the major topic at the two-day osce meeting to be held in sofia, capital of bulgaria.
the supreme court in ukraine has made a dramatic ruling, ordering a re-vote for the recent second round of the presidential run-off, while the european union earlier called on the osce member states to prepare for observers to act "with fastest speed and efficiency."
sources in europe disclosed that in the run-off scheduled to be re-held on december 26 in ukraine, the number of observers dispatched by the osce may increase to 1,000 from the previous 600.
us secretary of state powell will attend this osce annual meeting, on perhaps his last tour before leaving his post.
russian foreign minister lavrov, french foreign minister barnier, british foreign minister straw and german foreign minister fischer will also attend the meeting.
the osce is made up of 55 countries in north america, europe, and asia, and will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year.
this organization was established back then at a meeting held in helsinki and contributed to the ending of the cold war.
bush to face big test as intelligence reform bill goes for a vote at congress this week
the intelligence reform bill that us congress will try its best to pass this week marks republican president bush's efforts to press his ambitious second-term agenda and the first big test of his support among republican congressmen after he was re-elected.
kean, former republican governor of new jersey who led the investigation into the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington in the united states, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the problem with the intelligence reform bill lies in its passage by congress. this issue alone did not forebode well for the future bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda.
kean said: "if the president and congress cannot get these big issues taken care of, congress will become dysfunctional and then we'll all be in trouble."
he told new york daily news: "we'll have to wait a long time before another bill can get the support of republican and democratic leaders in both houses and the support of 80% of the people in the polls."
several congressmen said yesterday that if this history-making reform bill fails, it will delay the overhaul of america's antiquated spy network operation by months, even years, or even kill it altogether.
harman, top democrat on congress's house of representatives' intelligence committee, said yesterday on cnn television: "if this bill cannot be passed this week, it will be dead before being born."
congress will make another attempt to pass the "intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004" on the 6th and the 7th before adjourning till early next year.
if it is not passed, the entire act will be scrapped to be re-drafted in the 2005 congress session.
ukrainian opposition firmly rejects constitutional amendment bill that greatly reduces presidential power
ukrainian pro-western opposition insisted today that the opposition will not accept the constitutional reform pushed forward by outgoing president kuchma before re-holding the second round of the presidential run-off.
this constitutional reform will take away the majority of the current presidential power.
after the supreme court annulled the november 21 election on the grounds that the second-round of election was riddled with fraud, and the central election commission ordered a repeat run-off on december 26, the opposition leader yushchenko again found himself in a stand-off with kuchman.
yushchenko's ally tymoshenko said: "if the constitutional amendment bill is passed in its current form, all the presidential power will be transferred to the parliament, which is unacceptable."
she told reporters: "we hope the president can appoint the director of the intelligence bureau and the prosecutor general so that we can fight corruption and eliminate that bloc that controls the political and business communities in ukraine."
kuchma, who has close ties with russia, pressed for the constitutional amendment ahead of the repeat run-off for fear that the opposition might win the presidential election.
yesterday opposition parliament members refused to vote on the constitutional amendment bill proposed by the government, which led the parliament to adjourn for ten days.
according to the constitutional amendment bill, except for the prime minister, national defense minister and foreign minister, the power to appoint all other chiefs will be transferred from the president to the parliament where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority.
as set forth in this amendment bill, candidates for the prime minister, national defense minister and foreign minister appointed by the president need to be approved by the parliament, while the parliament can also nominate their candidates.
political crisis in ukraine enters third week as opposition calls for continued protests
the turmoil in ukraine triggered by the presidential election entered the third week as the opposition leader yushchenko called on masses of supporters today to continue their street protests and blockade the presidential office and government buildings till outgoing president kuchma sacks prime minister yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming repeat presidential run-off.
tens of thousands of yushchenko supporters have congregated in the capital kiev for two weeks.  they blockaded the government buildings and camped on the main streets specifically designed by russian experts for military parade.  the power of people they have demonstrated has forced the supreme court to annul the second round of the presidential election held on november 21, the central election commission to order a repeat run-off on december 26, and the parliament to approve firing yanukovych.  however, kuchma has so far not signed the executive order to remove this successor whom he has nurtured all along.
yushchenko told the supporting masses that gathered on the capital's independence square tonight that kuchma should dismiss his government and reorganize the central election commission and that both the parliament and kuchma should agree to amend the electoral law so as to prevent election fraud.
he said in this speech that kicks off the run-off on december 26: "there should be no talks on removing the blockade of government buildings or the presidential office before these decisions are made.
for fourteen days, this square has shown a love for ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of ukrainian people who can defend their choice."
he said: "we're experiencing a struggle between good and evil.  the whole world is applauding for our victory, and the whole world is proud of ukraine."
while the opposition increased the pressure on the ruling regime backed by moscow, and yushchenko and kuchma faced anew a stand-off on constitutional reforms, polish president kwasniewski, lithuanian president adamkus, and russian special envoy gryzlov are scheduled to arrive in kiev for another round of mediation.
egypt announces breakthrough in middle east peace deadlock
egypt said that the middle east peace agreement is expected to have a new framework.
it also said that it may soon dispatch its ambassador again to israel and restore full diplomatic relations that have been discontinued for four years.
quoting "high-level" egyptian sources, egypt's state-run mena said that all parties seeking a peace plan have come to a consensus on a comprehensive reconciliation.
mena said: "egypt, israel, palestine and key international parties such as the united states and the european union have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to a comprehensive solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict."
since the palestinian strongman arafat passed away last month, the international community has resumed pushing for the policy to restore the middle east peace in order to bring an early end to years of bloody conflict between israel and palestine.
mena said officials expect "preparations will continue into july and then be followed by political actions."
mena said that afterwards, all parties concerned with the middle east peace process, israel, palestine, egypt, the united states, russia and several european countries will hold a meeting in washington.
the meeting is expected to cover "a bilateral ceasefire."  the palestinian authority shall "put a stop to anti-israel attacks and strengthen its control over the gaza strip and the west bank."
regarding this issue, mena said, israeli prime minister sharon promised that "as long as the palestinian authority respects the ceasefire agreement and takes good control of its territories, israel will stop military actions against palestinians."
more than one billion children worldwide ravaged by war, poverty and aids
the unicef annual report released today pointed out that more than one billion children, half of the world's total, are brutally ravaged by poverty, war and aids.
unicef said the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as clearly laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child, were often imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms.
ms. bellamy, the unicef executive director, pointed out at the annual report launch in london, "when half of the world's children are growing up in hunger and in unhealthy environment, when schools have become targets of attacks and entire villages are destroyed by aids, we have failed to deliver our promise to children."
bellamy added: "too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually harm children."
the statistical data jointly compiled by unicef and researchers from britain's london school of economics and bristol university revealed a horrific picture of children at risk in most part of the world.
researchers found that some 640 million children worldwide lack adequate shelters, 400 million have no access to safe drinking water, 270 million have no healthcare, 140 million (mostly girls) have never attended schools.
more seriously, researchers pointed out, at least 700 million children suffer from all sorts of "severe exploitation," including no access to information and public sanitation facilities.
the tenth annual report released by unicef today pointed out that war and aids have destroyed all kinds of networks that normally can protect children and that at times children have become direct victims of war and aids.
eu resists china's pressure for lifting arms embargo
the european union rejected today the pressure from china's premier wen jiabao to put a quick end to the arms embargo on china yet said it will work hard toward lifting the 15-year-old ban.
the netherlands, which holds the european union's rotating presidency, made the above remark after the eu-china summit.
the netherlands said there should not be any guesses as to how the european union is going to put an end to the embargo.
the european union imposed the arms embargo on beijing following the massacre in tiananmen square in 1989.
although the issue of the arms embargo clouded this china-eu summit, both parties still signed some trade and other agreements at the meeting.
both china and the european union claimed that these agreements have strengthened their mutual "strategic partnership."
the european union said in a joint statement issued after its summit meeting with china's premier wen jiabao: "the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo."
the statement said the chinese delegation "welcomed this positive signal and believed this signal will benefit the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between china and the european union."
wen jiabao made no effort to hide his displeasure in a press conference after the summit and said this embargo "does not reflect the partnership between china and the european union."
wen jiabao said: "this embargo was a result of the cold war.  it cannot reflect the current situation, nor can it reflect the partnership between china and the european union."
led by france, some eu countries are working to have this arms embargo lifted, claiming this embargo is already out of date.
without adding any amendment to strengthen the related eu laws, some wise eu officials are worried that lifting the embargo may open the floodgates to arms sales and help enhance china's military capabilities.
dutch prime minister balkenende said: "i have explained that the european union has the wish to lift the embargo, but i have also made it clear that lifting the ban is closely connected with making adjustment to the code of conduct on arms exports."
preliminary study yields inconclusive finding that folic acid may lead to breast cancer
a latest health study pointed out that "folic acid," a b vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to prevent birth defects, may increase the risk of getting breast cancer.
however, researchers said the result of their study may be merely the result of chance because other studies show folic acid can actually reduce the risk of breast cancer.  therefore, they urged pregnant women to continue taking this supplement.
folic acid, found naturally in dark-color leafy vegetables, is known in the medical community to provide a key aid in the growth of a fetus.
researchers from the two universities of bristol and aberdeen in britain kept track of 3,000 women who, in the 1960s, either took five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo mostly during the second and third trimester of their pregnancy.
the report carried in the british medical journal said that by september 2002 breast cancer rates for the women who took five milligrams of folic acid turned out to be twice as high as for those who merely took the placebo.
ness, one of the researchers, stressed that this result was only "preliminary...intended to point toward the way toward further research."
he said: "it is entirely possible that this is a chance result.  so further scientific studies are required to examine the association if such an association exists before we reach any conclusion."
ness said women who are planning to become pregnant should still take the supplement of folic acid.
he said "there is a considerable difference between the trial dosage" and the current suggested dosage.
according to the british health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a daily dose of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid, more than 10 times smaller than the dose taken by the women in the study.
two candidates of two entirely different moods in ukraine's presidential re-run
the two opponents confronting each other in ukraine's presidential re-run on the 26th of this month have now readied themselves for a decisive battle.
pro-western opposition leader yushchenko is confident of winning the election, while pro-moscow incumbent prime minister yanukovych says he will no longer run on behalf of the "shameful" ruling party.
in the meantime, russia's president putin changed his stance toward ukraine's eu accession, saying he would be happy to see ukraine join the european union.
asked what percentage of the vote he is expecting to get in the re-run, yushchenko said to reporters who packed the conference room: "to be conservative, i should be able to get about 60%."
on the other hand, yanukovych, anxiety written all over his face, evaded directly answering reporters' questions several times and finally said simply: "by god's will, we will win."
yanukovych, originally trained by current president kuchma as his successor, has now made a departure, positioning himself as a candidate against both the opposition and ruling parties.
he said, in a manner bordering on name-calling: "i used to trust those cowards and traitors working for the government.  now i feel nothing but great disappointment.  this government is indeed a shame."
in an exchange of conditions with the opposition party, kuchma tried to amend laws in order to transfer some presidential power to the parliament so as to end massive opposition protests and political turmoil that have gone on for two weeks since the november 21 presidential runoff.
the original winner yanukovych has also had his election invalidated by the supreme court due to the fraud-riddled voting process and must go through a re-election.
powell visits hague to offer his final efforts at us-eu harmony during his term
us secretary of state powell today held a meeting with top eu officials to offer his final efforts at us-eu solidarity during his term.
the purpose of this european visit by powell was to repair diplomatic damage on both sides due to the iraq war.  the hague was his last stop.
the trip may be powell's last official visit abroad during his term.  the european union promised him that it will work toward easing tensions between the two sides before us president bush's visit to europe next february.
however, differences between the two sides still linger.
foreign minister bot of the netherlands, which holds the rotating eu presidency, said: "we must intensify bilateral dialogue during president bush's second term and rediscover our common ground."
ms. waldner, eu external relations commissioner, said she believed europe and the united states have made some progress in "putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind," but she also acknowledged that now is a "key moment in the eu-us relationship."
bush will fly to brussels on february 22 next year to meet with eu and nato leaders.
powell said bush's visit is meant to mend fissures in the relationship caused by the iraq issue.
on his visit to europe, powell stopped in sofia and brussels but made only limited progress toward his goal of improving ties.
this was especially the case in brussels, where powell criticized six anti-war nato countries for hurting the alliance's "credibility and solidarity" by refusing to participate in training exercises in iraq.
however, powell still insisted his meetings have demonstrated us commitment to fully rehabilitating diplomatic relations.
elected as romanian president, basescu faces challenges in organizing government
romania's opposition candidate basescu today won a closely-fought presidential election, but due to a hung parliament, the center-right mayor of bucharest may face tremendous challenges in organizing a new government.
according to the final official results released today by romania's central election commission, "justice and truth alliance" candidate basescu won 51.23% of the vote, while his opponent, prime minister nastase, won 48.77%.
nastase conceded defeat and congratulated basescu.
outgoing president iliescu has also congratulated basescu.
nastase said his social democratic party will assist basescu in securing romania's smooth accession to the european union.
the social democratic party won parliamentary elections held on the 28th of last month.
basescu said at a press conference: "my priority today is to form, as soon as possible, a government capable of continuing negotiations for romania's entry into the european union."  romania must work hard to meet the requirements for eu accession.
he stressed that the romanian people should understand the price to pay for this integration.  the entire country should unite to ensure there are no dissenting voices in romania against the integration.
romania has completed its eu membership negotiations and is scheduled to join the union in january 2007.
basescu's agenda also includes combating poverty, tackling corruption, and ensuring judicial independence.
oliver stone wants to seek peace with turkey in spite of lingering dispute over old screenplay
movie director oliver stone, while promoting his new movie "alexander" in istanbul, tried to take the chance today to make peace with turkey.
his screenplay for the classic "midnight express" was criticized for tarnishing the image of turkey.
in a special interview here he told afp: "it has never occurred to me that this screenplay would be against turkey.  this screenplay is meant to be against injustice everywhere."
turkey has been denouncing stone ever since the premier of this award-winning movie in 1978.
the movie was based on the memoirs of billy hayes.
hayes, a young american, got arrested at istanbul airport while trying to smuggle hashish from turkey.  after a protracted lawsuit, he was sentenced to 30 years in jail in turkey.
turkish critics accused stone of taking liberties with hayes's original work and rewriting it as a racist screenplay in which every turkish character is, without exception, described as a villain.
the movie is also filled with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture.
stone admitted: "perhaps some of the zealousness, some of the anger came from being young at that time and trying to make the point too much, too hard."
but he added: "it was true that billy hayes did get screwed in the turkish prison. he was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years in jail, and he was treated brutally in prison. so this is all based on facts."
stone said: "for a larger picture, turkey is not the only country that runs an imperfect prison system.  america has similar problems."
japan's economy may slow down next year
japan's economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing gap between rich and poor may spoil the harmonious atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of this year.
after a decade of stagnation, high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have brought confidence back to japan this year, but analysts put their hopes of sustaining economic growth on china despite growing political tensions between japan and china.
the evidence is growing that japan's economy could suffer a brief downturn in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust their inventories to avoid a glut.
according to a new statistic methodology recently adopted, japan's economy actually shrank slightly in the april-june quarter and grew only 0.1% in the july-september quarter, narrowly escaping a technical recession.
at present, economists still hold very different opinions on the momentum of economic rebound in japan.
bnp paribas researchers estimated that the actual economic growth in japan can reach 2.3% for both the current fiscal year ending in march next year and the following fiscal year.
they called 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the us economy is on a steady recovery track and japan's consumer spending is making up for slower exports.
in another more pessimistic view, ufj institute economists projected only 1.8% growth in this fiscal year and even a much slower growth of 0.6% for the following fiscal year.
they cited the "potential risk," which means corporate profits do not lead to higher personal incomes.
french foreign minister: middle east peace process will test ties between france and us
after meeting us secretary of state powell today, french foreign minister barnier said the efforts to revive middle east peace talks will "test" their trans-atlantic ties.
after the death of the palestinian leader arafat, france called for an immediate international conference to push for the peace process between israel and palestine.  however, there hasn't been any sign of reaching an agreement after barnier and powell finished their meeting.
barnier flew to washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with powell and his internally designated successor, national security adviser rice, before turning around and heading to brussels for an eu summit.
both paris and washington agreed to repair bilateral relations strained by the us invasion of iraq last year, but the two countries still remain very much divided on the resolution to the middle east deadlock.
after a brief talk with powell at the us state department, barnier said: "we hope to improve future relations between france and the united states, and between europe and america."
he said: "i think the test at the heart of this relationship... is our ability to launch the peace process between palestine and israel."
earlier this week barnier called for an immediate international conference on the middle east to take advantage of what he termed a "window of opportunity" created after arafat's death last month.
but powell still did not want to make any commitment.
he said the two had spoken of british plans to hold a meeting participated by palestinians but did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held.
us officials have made it clear that their priority is to promote peace in israel and palestine and to ensure smooth palestinian elections next month.
the elections will produce a leader who could rein in islamic militants and revive talks between israel and palestine.
foreign minister machimura proposes japan and south korea hold fta negotiations next january
japan's foreign minister nobutaka machimura proposed today that japan and south korea hold negotiations on a free trade agreement (fta) as early as january next year.
according to the report by jiji press, during a meeting with ban ki-moon, south korea's minister of foreign affairs and trade, in ibusuki city of the southern kagoshima county, machimura said the two sides should resume the negotiations as early as possible since both tokyo and seoul authorities hope to sign an fta by the end of 2005.
before machimura's talks with ban ki-moon, japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korean president roh moo-hyun held a summit on the 17th.  during the talks, roh moo-hyun urged tokyo authorities to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against north korea.
as north korea abducted several japanese nationals during the cold war, prime minister koizumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish north korea.
after japanese researchers confirmed last week that the remains provided by pyongyang authorities to prove the death of the two hostages were not the remains of the parties involved, the families of kidnapping victims were outraged.
apart from the abduction issue, koizumi and roh moo-hyun agreed that six-party talks aimed at halting north korea's development of nuclear weapons should resume as early as possible.
since north korea's secret development of nuclear weapons triggered a stand-off in october 2002, three rounds of six-party talks have taken place but all failed to achieve concrete results.
north korea later boycotted a fourth round of six-party talks originally scheduled for september this year.
the six parties for the talks are respectively south korea, north korea, the united states, china, japan, and russia.
thai premier thaksin still expected to win elections in february next year
when thai premier thaksin heads into 2005, he is confident of winning a second four-year term.  however, his reputation has already been tarnished because he has failed to quell a bloody separatist insurgency.
as thailand's national elections have been scheduled for february 6 next year, thaksin and his political opponents are actively preparing for the elections.  in the opinion of most analysts, he is expected to win despite this year's serious southern violence and epidemic of bird flu.
this year a total of twelve people in thailand died from bird flu, which swept across much of asia but was particularly devastating in thailand. the thai government frankly admitted it "made a mistake" in its handling of the epidemic.
however, this health concern is unlikely to ruin thaksin's chance of a second term. on the contrary, many people are asking only how extensive his victory will be, and what will his election victory mean to the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces.
kraisak, chairman of the parliamentary senate's committee on foreign affairs, told afp: "the phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at thaksin, he has won broad popular support at this moment."
he said: "but things will start to disintegrate next year, if you look at the accumulation of wealth (by his family and those close to him), the social injustices and the violence."
it is exactly because of social injustice and violence, insurgency broke out in the muslim-dominant deep south of thailand, where sporadic separatist incidents have occurred continuously since january.
since january this year, islamic radicals have targeted buddhists, government officials and security forces in gun battles and they have also carried out bombings and beheadings.  as of now more than 560 people have died, and another 100 are missing.
palestinian cabinet secretary claims arafat was poisoned about a year ago
abdelrahman, cabinet secretary for late palestinian leader arafat, disclosed that arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his ramallah headquarters.
abdelrahman told the al-hayat newspaper: "about a year ago, something strange happened to arafat.  it was on september 25, 2003.
at that time the chairman was shaking hands one by one with some 30 representatives of supporters.  shortly afterwards, the chairman started to vomit.
since then the chairman's health started to deteriorate gradually."
arafat died of a mysterious illness in a french hospital on november 11.
some of palestinian top officials thought arafat had been poisoned.
however, french doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations.
two weeks before the delegation visit to arafat mentioned by abdelrahman, the israeli cabinet headed by prime minister sharon had just made the decision to depose arafat, only without specifying by what means.
this threat from israel prompted a wave of people's support for arafat, who subsequently received several delegations of supporters.
abdelrahman recalled, "arafat shook hands with these people who came to express their support for arafat besieged by israel."
on september 25 last year, arafat received two groups successively.  one was a group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission.  the other was a group of political activists.
abdelrahman pointed out, "october 12 this year was the last time when arafat got ill.  the symptoms were the same, vomiting, lack of appetite and all the similar symptoms of having the flu."
bush admits need to step up training for iraqi troops and vigorously defends rumsfeld
us president bush admitted today that iraqi troops are not yet ready to replace us troops and warned that the elections scheduled for january 30 next year would not spell the end of serious violence in iraq.
in an-hour-long press conference, bush also expressed his support for defense minister rumsfeld, insisting the pentagon chief was "doing a really fine job."
bush said, despite some sharp disagreements sometimes, he vowed to continue working with russian president putin.  he also said that now is the time to make progress toward ending the middle east conflict.
he also believed that the best way to deal with surviving "axis of evil" members iran and north korea is to go through multilateral diplomacy.
after yesterday's successive car bombings killed 66 people and injured more than 200 in the two iraqi islamic shiite pilgrimage cities of najaf and karbala, bush admitted frankly that violence was taking its toll on iraqi people but insisted the elections in january must take place as scheduled.
bush warned americans that iraq's elections "are just the beginning of a political process" and cautioned that "i certainly don't think the process will be trouble-free."
bush also acknowledged that training iraqi security forces had mixed results.
he said: "sometimes when fighting intensified, they (iraqi troops) would desert the battlefield."
he said this kind of iraqi troops will never be able to protect the national security, which is unacceptable.
however, he believed that after a long period of training by us troops, the training of iraqi troops will achieve results.
white house: iraqi insurgents' attempt to sabotage elections is doomed to fail
in response to insurgents' attack on a dining hall in a us military base in the major city of mosul in northern iraq at noon today that killed 22 us and iraqi soldiers and injured more than 60, the white house spokesman mcclellan said there will be more rampant terrorist activities by iraqi insurgents as iraqi elections approach, but these "enemies of freedom" will be surely wiped out.
reports from iraq said that a single massive explosion occurred at noontime in a us military base dining hall when officers and soldiers were eating, resulting in heavy casualties.
the iraqi provisional government set january 30 for the first elections since the downfall of the hussein regime.
the united states has sent nearly 20,000 additional troops to ensure security in iraq during the elections.
the total number of us troops in iraq during the elections will reach 150,000.
mclellan said as the elections approach, hussein loyalists and insurgents will create more terrorist attacks in an attempt to sabotage the interim government.  they want to go back to the past but "they will be wiped out, and they are being wiped out."
reacting to a latest poll which shows 56% of americans think the iraq war "is not worth fighting," 57% disapprove the way president bush is handling the situation in iraq, and 52% think defense minister rumsfeld should step down, mclellan said president bush will not dance attendance on polls.
"polls are momentary numbers, while we continue to do our job based on the progress we made in iraq."
crowds of mourners attend funeral for philippine politician poe
a large crowd of filipino movie fans attended today's funeral for poe, the country's most famous movie star.  the ceremony was conducted under tight security for fear of unrest.
poe, 65, had unsuccessfully run for president.
a crowd of mourners escorted the coffin carrying poe's body as it was pulled through the streets of the capital of manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses.
an army of riot police was deployed around malacanang palace to prevent violence from poe supporters.
these supporters had accused president arroyo of cheating in the may 10 presidential election.
the military also raised its alert level due to intelligence reports about an imminent coup to overthrow arroyo and replace her with rocess, poe's surviving widow.
however, the funeral procession ended peacefully.  movie fans shouted out the letters fpj, the initials of poe's name, and waved his campaign posters.
poe died of a stroke on december 14.
as the hearse wound its way toward the cemetery, weeping women and children tossed flowers at the coffin.
following justice secretary gonzales's warning that some people might take advantage of the funeral to make trouble, large freight containers were placed as road blocks around malacanang palace close to the funeral procession route.
gonzales said that "reliable intelligence reports" indicated a plot to use the occasion of the funeral procession and interment to incite people against the government.
however, lt. col. pascual, a military spokesman, said that the political coup had apparently dissipated after the military deployed troops to guard key areas.
arroyo later walked out of malacanang palace to greet the military police who were guarding the area.
syria must cooperate with us on issue of israel and lebanon, armitage warns
us deputy secretary of state armitage issued warnings to syria today, saying the development of future relations between damascus and washington depends on whether syria wants to cooperate with the united states on the issues of iraq and lebanon.
armitage renewed greater pressures on syria when he was interviewed by reporters from arab countries.
the interview was released earlier by the state department.
asked whether he expected continued tensions between the united states and syria, armitage replied: "i certainly hope the relations will be improved, but this depends on how (syrian president)al-assad and his men behave."
the us state department number two pointed out that damascus should implement the un security council resolution 1559 passed in september this year and end as soon as possible all interferences in its neighboring country lebanon.
armitage said syria's behavior was "not a defiance of the united states but a defiance of the entire international community."
reporters asked again whether the united states will raise the issue of syria's refusal to cooperate when the un security council discusses whether un peacekeeping troops should remain in lebanon in january next year. to this, armitage replied: "we'll very likely do that."
speaking of the iraq issue, armitage acknowledged that damascus had indeed taken some steps that met us expectations by reinforcing joint border patrols with iraq and halting insurgent funding.
however, he also said that syria "still needs to make greater efforts."
ait and tecro sign lease today for new building site in neihu
the american institute in taiwan (ait) and the taipei economic and cultural representative office (tecro) signed a lease today for a new building site in neihu.  douglas paal, director of the ait taipei office, said the new building is now being designed, and that he hopes it will be completed soon so the institute's work can be done in a safe and modern facility.
douglas paal and tecro secretary general john chen signed a 99-year lease for the new ait office building site at noon in taipei's chun yue hotel.
witnesses were david keegan, deputy director of the ait taipei office, and jacqueline liu, deputy secretary general of tecro.  minister of foreign affairs mark chen was also present for the ceremony.
ait, established under the taiwan relations act to handle unofficial civil exchanges between the united states and taiwan, has offices in taipei and kaohsiung.
douglas paal said in his speech that ait has been working with tecro and the taipei city government for over a decade to find a new ait office building site.
he said the current office at hsing yi road looks shabby and lacks enough space.
for ait, relocating to the new office building will be a challenge, as it will be able to consolidate offices currently scattered throughout taipei to operate in a safe and modern facility.
he said the new building is currently being planned and designed in a way that he hopes will add features to taiwan's architecture and become a point of pride for taipei residents.
upon completion of the planning and design, contract bidding will be set for construction, which will begin right after the contractor has made its decision.  it is hoped that groundbreaking will take place within the next few years.
ait spokeswoman dana shell-smith said the building's cost, including the site lease and architectural design, is estimated at about us$160 million.  its completion in 2008 depends on many factors, though it is hoped to be done as quickly as possible.
thousands of pilgrims rush to attend christmas eve mass in bethlehem
thousands of pilgrims are gathering in the west bank town of bethlehem for christmas eve mass.
in the meantime, plo mainstream group al fatah is expected to have defeated hamas in yesterday's local palestinian elections.
regarding violence and conflict, a gun battle broke out between israeli troops and palestinian gunmen in gaza, resulting in the deaths of three young palestinians.
israeli settlers, on the other hand, blockaded a main road in protest against mortar attacks on their settlement.
also, plo leader abbas was allowed to travel to the west bank town of bethlehem.  it was the first time in the past four years that israeli authorities allowed a key palestinian leader to attend christmas celebrations there.
late palestinian leader arafat was a regular guest at the midnight mass in bethlehem following his return to the palestinian area in 1994.  but since early december 2001, arafat had been confined to his ramallah headquarters by israeli troops.
the latin patriarch sabbah of jerusalem left that city in early afternoon for his traditional trip to bethlehem's manger square, where thousands of christian pilgrims and muslim spectators had long been congregating.
sabbah was scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at church of the nativity midnight mass.
by noon, manger square was packed with a continuous stream of pilgrims toting santa claus balloons entering and leaving the church of the nativity.  outside the church, a christmas tree was festooned with various lights and decorations.
israeli authorities eased travel restrictions in a special effort to make it convenient for christians from the gaza strip, the west bank, and israel to attend christmas eve mass in bethlehem.
putin claims taking over main asset of yukos was for protecting national interest
russian president putin said today that russia was protecting its national interest by its acquisition of the main asset of russia's oil giant yukos, a first move of re-nationalization in the post-soviet era.
referring to rosneft's acquisition of yuganskneftegaz, a yukos subsidiary, putin said at the end-of-year press conference held in the kremlin: "russia is now protecting the national interest by using absolute legal market mechanism.
and i consider this perfectly normal."
rosneft today has become the new owner of yuganskneftegaz after acquiring baikalfinansgroup which won yuganskneftegaz earlier at a secretive auction.
earlier last midnight rosneft announced unexpectedly that it had acquired 100% of shares of the previously unknown baikalfinansgroup.
the acquisition allows kremlin to have a tight control of russia's critical energy sector.
for nearly 18 months in the past, russian authorities had been attacking yukos and its imprisoned billionaire founder khodorkovsky.
since rosneft is merging with gazprom, combined with yuganskneftegaz, the consolidated trio will control one fifth of russia's total oil output and all its natural gas production to become the world's largest energy group.
putin justified the state's current acquisition by criticizing the under-the-table privatization in the 1990s.
the privatization measures at that time caused the crown jewels of the russian economy to fall into the hands of a few slick businessmen such as khodorkovsky.
baikalfinansgroup earlier won the controlling rights to yuganskneftegaz by offering us$9.35 billion for the bid.
yushchenko claims victory in ukraine's presidential election
as the preliminary election results showed opposition leader yushchenko took the lead in the presidential re-run over his opponent, incumbent prime minister yanunovych, and yushchenko himself also declared victory, his supporters today gathered again in kiev's central independence square to celebrate the victory.
the 50-year-old yushchenko said to people gathering in the square: "this is a unique and clean political victory."
he said: "this is a noble victory.  people have demonstrated their power.  the ukrainian people have stood up bravely to fight against what may be the most perverted regime among eastern european countries.  and today the ukrainian nation and its people have won the victory."
he said: "for 14 years, we have been independent but not free."
yushchenko added: "today ukraine has unfolded a new political era.
the era of (outgoing president) kuchma, (kuchma's predecessor) kravtchouk and (current prime minister) yanukovych has gone down in history."
citing the statistical results of the vote count in more than half of the precincts, ukraine's central election commission said today that opposition leader yushchenko, in this historic presidential re-vote, has taken a temporary 16-point lead over his opponent, current prime minister yanukovych.
ukraine's central commission said pro-western yushchenko won 56.33% of the vote, while pro-russia yanukovych got 39.86%.
this statistical result was based on the vote count by 50.96% of ukraine's polls.
there are more than 33,000 polls throughout ukraine.
in addition, the exit polls released earlier also showed that yushchenko led yanukovych by 15 to 20 percentage points.
japan's mic pilots telecommuting to reduce office stress on families
japan's ministry of internal affairs and communications (mic) today kicked off the promotion of an advanced internet program, through which, it hopes, 20% of japan's workforce can "telecommute" to work from home by 2010 so as to reduce the stress of office work and its consequent toll on families.
an mic official said that currently some 4 million japanese, or 6% of japan's workforce of 63.2 million, take advantage of science and technology to work from outside office.
beginning january, six mic staffers can stay away from office at least one day in a week and work instead from their homes, universities, or libraries through the high speed internet services.
based on feedbacks, the mic will expand the scope of this advanced program until 20% of its 2,500 employees can work from home by 2006.
the mic official said that this program allowing employees to hold meetings through internet chat rooms and teleconferencing is expected to "improve workplace efficiency."
he said telecommuting allows employees more time to be with their families and enables breadwinners to assist more in household chores.
he said the program can also reduce traffic jam, including vehicle emissions and overcrowding on trolleybuses during peak hours.
he said the goal of the program is to raise the percentage of japanese telecommuters to 10% by 2005 and further to 20% by 2010 "by encouraging the sharing of the telecommuting technology with private sector."
pentagon launches unprecedented relief operations for asian tsunami victims
the pentagon said today that it has launched one of the biggest relief operations in its history to assist victims of asian tsunamis, mobilizing two aircraft carrier strike groups, 20 airplanes including reconnaissance and supply planes, and tens of thousands of personnel.
lieutenant commander hicks, a pentagon spokesman, said that the us military faced the challenge of operating in several areas simultaneously after the tsunami catastrophe on the 26th that left over 80,000 people dead.
he told afp: "this is one of the biggest humanitarian relief operations by the pentagon."
lieutenant general conway, an official in charge of military operations for the joint chief of staff, said that they are seeking to assess the extent of this catastrophe and have already dispatched disaster relief assessment teams to thailand, sri lanka and indonesia.
the pentagon said that it has dispatched 20 airplanes to south asia, including six c-130 transport planes carrying drinking water and food, five kc-135 air refueling tanker planes, and nine p3 reconnaissance planes.
the pentagon has also mobilized aircraft carriers "the lincoln" and "the richard" with their groups of ships.
conway said that "the lincoln" strike group with its accompanying 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel has left hong kong for the gulf of siam and will eventually deploy off the coast of sumatra.
"the richard" carrying 25 helicopters, 2,100 marines, and 1,400 sailors has left the island of guam and is expected to reach the bay of bengal by january 7 next year.
the pentagon has decided to mobilize additional five ships from guam and two ships from its base on the indian ocean island of diego garcia that can produce fresh water.
conway said that the us military relief operations will be headquartered in its thai base of utapao on the gulf of siam.
at least 169 dead and 375 injured in nightclub blaze in capital of argentina
city officials in buenos aires, capital of argentina, said today that a blaze in a nightclub in downtown buenos aires on the evening of the 30th killed at least 169 people and injured 375.
the fire broke out when the nightclub was packed with some 2,000 young people celebrating the end of the school year.
the city health secretary stein said the above casualties are not the final figures yet.
fernandez, argentina's interior minister, told reporters outside the smoldering nightclub, "this is a disaster! this is a disaster!" and warned the death toll was only provisional.
stein said at least 375 people were injured in the blaze, including 19 police officers.
stein said that a fire broke out in this downtown discotheque before midnight on the 30th when some 2,000 young people were attending a rock concert there.
mayor ibarra of buenos aires said that unconfirmed reports claim the fire was caused when flares were tossed during the concert.
ibarra told today's news television station: "this is a horrible night."
while firefighters were trying their best to put out the blaze, bodies of victims were lined up on the street.
chaos reigned early this morning outside the blazing discotheque when hundreds of police officers and firefighters got mixed up with frightened young people and anxious parents searching frantically for their children.
un: relief supplies weeks away for aceh survivors
the united nations said today that it will take "weeks" for urgently-needed relief supplies to reach tsunami survivors in the isolated areas of indonesia's aceh province.
us navy helicopters have arrived today in banda aceh, capital of aceh province.  meanwhile, more and more field hospitals have started operating in the city and large shipments of relief supplies are arriving at the airport.
however, elmquist, the chief of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia, told reporters that a host of coordination and infrastructure problems made it impossible for a prompt delivery of relief supplies.
after returning to the capital jakarta from banda aceh, elmquist told reporters over the phone: "it will take us weeks before we can deliver relief supplies to all the isolated areas."
he said: "this is a serious concern.  we are trying all we can to find ways to establish an aid distribution system in banda aceh."
the united nations and other relief organizations have warned that people in the affected sumatra area in indonesia may die within a few days if they cannot immediately get clean drinking water, food, and medical treatment.
asked whether delays in delivery mean death sentences for some tsunami survivors, elmquist replied: "i hope not.  i hope survivors can manage to find food and drinking water, but this is certainly not the situation we would be happy to see."
he said: "this is a very serious situation.  we can only hope that it is possible to speed up the operation."
japan tops world donors with pledge of us$500 million in relief aid
japan pledged us$500 million in relief aid today to countries devastated by the massive tsunami in the indian ocean.  while all nations compete with one another in offering aid to survivors of the most lethal catastrophe in the world, this contribution not only made japan the top donor of all nations but also raised the money hitherto pledged by the international community for relief and reconstruction to a total of us$1.6 billion.
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi said in a statement that japan, as the largest economy in asia, will consider providing more assistance including money and technology.
he said: "japan will try to its maximum capacity to provide assistance in three ways: financial resources, knowledge and technology, and human resources."
he said: "japan will, for the time being, first provide a grant of us$500 million to affected countries and relevant international organizations as emergency aid to cope with the disaster."
koizumi also said that he will attend the meeting of world leaders to be held on the 6th in the indonesian capital of jakarta to discuss assistance to tsunami-stricken countries.
after us president bush was accused of being slow to respond to this human catastrophe, the us government increased its pledge of aid tenfold to us$350 million yesterday.
china, which is seen as increasingly challenging japan's influence in asia, has also promised us$60.5 million in aid, a huge sum for a developing nation.
koizumi said: "japan will mobilize fire department helicopters and personnel to make further contribution.
japan will also consider providing more assistance, as soon as possible, including mobilizing japan's self-defense forces aircraft, ships and personnel."
japan previously pledged us$30 million in aid to tsunami-stricken countries.
a foreign ministry spokesperson said that koizumi's pledge of us$500 million also includes that amount of us$30 million.
who: 50 organizations to provide medical aid to aceh in indonesia
the who said today that 50 aid groups have arrived in the indonesian province of aceh ready to provide medical assistance to tsunami survivors.
who representative in indonesia peterson said that the who is trying to coordinate all groups and has held a meeting with them this afternoon.
peterson said the coordination is challenging as many groups have gone directly to aceh to administer relief.
in a telephone interview in jarkata, peterson said: "we are trying to sort things out.  every group has just arrived, yet each has also expressed their willingness to work together."
peterson reiterated that the who is mainly concerned with preventing outbreaks of such diseases as cholera and dysentery, which can cause deaths by tens of thousands.
peterson said: "we are very worried because we have many displaced people, who don't have adequate clean water or appropriate food.
so we have all the conditions necessary for an outbreak of epidemic."
however, peterson stressed there hasn't been any sign yet of these diseases.
indonesian health ministry said the death toll in sumatra during the tsunami may be as high as 100,000 with most of the victims in the province of aceh.
since most of the medical facilities have been destroyed in the province of aceh, indonesian military, singapore, and australian government have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week.  the unicef has also started to distribute basic medical kits to assist 200,000 children.
powell predicts shiite victory in iraqi elections
us secretary of state powell today predicted a shiite victory in the upcoming iraqi elections, but he also believed there should not be too much concern that the shiite victory may increase iranian influence because there are past disagreements between iraqi and iranian shias.
there has been growing evidence that sunni muslims may boycott the elections on january 30 or may be prohibited from participating in the elections by the relevant iraqi authorities due to their spreading of insurgency.
powell said on nbc's meet the press program: "the new government going into power and the transitional national assembly will be majority shiite.
the majority of iraqi population is also shiite."
shiite muslims make up more than 60% of iraq's population, living mostly in southern and central areas.
on the other hand, sunnis live in central and western provinces and comprise 20% of the population.
former foreign minister pachachi, who now heads the sunni-dominated "iraqi independent democrats party," called today for postponing the elections, but powell said the iraqi elections will go ahead as scheduled.
powell also said he did not think shiites' control of the future iraqi government could mean iran would manipulate the political situation in iraq.
he said: "my feeling now is that even if there might be iranian influence--iran will, of course, try to influence the political situation in iraq, but there are quite significant differences and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shias."
time is running against tsunami victims as international relief aid pours in
foreign troops on relief mission are dropping food from helicopters in areas hit by the asian tsunamis and setting up drinking water distribution systems to assist millions of displaced and famished tsunami survivors.
according to statistics, the death toll has climbed to nearly 150,000.
relief supplies from governments keep coming in while us president bush put his father, bush senior, and former president clinton in charge of efforts to raise private donations.
in the meantime, the delegation led by us secretary of state powell arrived in thailand last night to show us concern and assess the progress of relief efforts before they head off to a crisis summit to be held in the indonesian capital of jakarta on the 6th.
powell's delegation includes president bush's brother jeb bush, governor of florida, and natsios, administrator of us agency for international development.
powell, heading the delegation, will tour thailand, indonesia, and sri lanka to inspect the disaster devastation before attending the summit on the 6th.
powell said the mission of his delegation is to assess the disaster situation and "see what else the united states needs to do," but there will be no immediate promise of additional aid beyond the us$350 million already committed.
as days went by after the disaster, there are talks now of giving up the search for thousands of tourists not yet accounted for.  many of them were foreign tourists.
but thai premier thaksin vowed to continue the search in his country.
thaksin told reporters on phuket island: "foreign experts told me they (the missing) might have been buried in mud in mangrove forests.  we will continue the search by all means and will not stop."
the international relief effort of the largest scale in history is still underway.
navy helicopters dispatched from the us aircraft carrier "the lincoln" have been on their mission to drop relief supplies and pick up survivors in the indonesian province of aceh for a second day.
rear admiral crowder, commander of the lincoln, said 50,000 pounds of food and water had so far been delivered to affected areas and the operation was "going smoothly."
behind tsunami catastrophe relief efforts lies political jostle
as asian tsunami disaster relief supplies continuously poured into affected areas, a less praiseworthy operation is also secretly underway: governments are jostling over who should be giving money, who should be receiving aid and who should be leading this relief operation of the largest scale in modern times.
the catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled the old fire of war, including the discord among the united states, the united nations and europe, and the struggle for leadership in asia.
relief experts, however, are still hoping with caution that the global nature of this tsunami catastrophe that devastated so many countries might lead to another precedent: governments that promised to provide aid will actually honor their words.
juma, professor of international development of harvard's kennedy school of government, said: "promises of aid made by governments have never been carried out 100% and on time."
with pledged donations from governments hitting us$2 billion, major players in the international political arena including un secretary general annan and us secretary of state powell, and leaders from australia, china and japan will hold a crisis summit with strong political overtones in jarkata on the 6th.
after accusations of a slow response and top un relief official egeland's public criticism of rich countries for "being stingy," us president bush raised us aid nearly tenfold to us$350 million.
in asia, the tsunami catastrophe triggered a secretive jostle for regional influence as an increasingly confident china pledged us$60.5 million in aid, an impressive big sum for a developing country.
japan, which has cut down foreign aid budget for six straight years, also quickly debunked the notion that its national power is declining by vowing to provide at least us$500 million in aid, a sum putting all other nations to shame.
world leaders arriving to tour disaster-hit sri lanka
sri lankan officials said world government leaders including un secretary general annan, us secretary of state powell have arrived in succession in sri lanka to inspect firsthand the devastation of the massive tsunami that claimed 30,600 lives in sri lanka at the end of last month.
they said powell has arrived here and south korean prime minister lee hae-chan will be coming in early afternoon.
in a press release by the us embassy, it is said that powell will tour some areas hit hardest by the tsunami on december 26 last year, including the southern region of galle where us marines are stationed for relief operations.
south korean embassy, on the other hand, said lee hae-chan will tour the western coastline accompanied by sri lanka's prime minister.
the statement said: "accompanied by sri lankan prime minister rajapakse, south korea's prime minister will tour the western coast to view firsthand the destruction of lives, livelihood and property."
lee hae-chan will stop over in hambantota, the worst affected area, to oversee relief operations being carried out by private and non-governmental organizations from south korea.
meanwhile, un secretary general annan is scheduled to arrive in the evening for a two-day visit.
the un spokesman samarsinghe said: "he will be touring along with world bank president wolfhensohn the affected regions in the south and the east."
who secretary general lee joog-wook will also arrive in colombo today.
german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to arrive in sri lanka by the weekend.
sri lankan officials said more world leaders will be arriving in the next few weeks.
these leaders include canadian prime minister martin.  canada announced yesterday that martin will visit sri lanka and thailand later this month.
bush: us to step up peace efforts after palestinian elections
us president bush said today that he was "deeply heartened" by the high turnout for today's palestinian elections and pledged to step up us peace efforts.
bush said in a statement: "palestinians throughout the west bank and the gaza strip took a key step toward building a future democracy by choosing a president of the new self-rule government through elections.
the election observers described the elections as free and fair."
he said: "this is a historic day for the palestinian people and the people in the middle east."
exit polls showed that former prime minister abbas won the elections by a wide margin with two thirds of the vote.
he will succeed arafat to become the president of the palestinian self-rule government.
bush said: "these efforts, including today's presidential elections and the elections for the national assembly in a few months, are essential for the establishment of a sovereign, independent, democratic and peaceful palestinian state.  the new state will ensure the security of israel."
he said the us government expects to work with the newly-elected president of the palestinian self-rule government and the palestinian people so as to press forward the great cause of the middle east peace.
the middle east peace conforms to the common wish of israeli and palestinian peoples for living side by side in peace and security.
bush also urged israel to help improve human rights and economic conditions on the west bank and the gaza strip.
he added that arab countries must "take joint concrete steps with all relevant parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace, offer financial support to the palestinian people, and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists."
annan's plan to visit rebel-controlled areas in sri lanka blocked
un secretary general annan said today that he hopes to be able to return to sri lanka some day to "visit every part of the country."
annan recently ended his two-day visit to tsunami-hit areas in sri lanka.  however, reports said that the sri lankan government had tried to block him from visiting rebel-controlled northern areas.
asked at a press conference whether the sri lankan government had blocked him from visiting rebel ltte (liberation tigers of tamil eelam) controlled areas, as reported by many national newspapers, annan said: "i hope i can return to visit every part of the country and assist in accelerating the peace process."
annan said president kumaratunga had personally objected to his on-site visit to guerrilla-held areas because she feared the rebels might use his visit as a political bargaining chip.
he said: "i brought up the issue of the peace process and the need to intensify peacemaking efforts.
i also discussed the issue with president kumaratunga."
annan's inability to visit rebel-controlled areas triggered great anger among residents of the rebel-controlled northern city of jaffna.  hundreds of people staged a protest in front of the un office in jaffna.
the sri lankan government, however, resolutely denied media reports, saying the media "had misled" on the issue.
in the meantime, as relief efforts from all sides moved forward at full steam, sri lanka's meteorology department issued warnings of a typhoon strike along the country's coastline.  the typhoon is currently forming at sea.
russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes sickness among children
britain's weekly science journal nature reported that the highly toxic rocket fuel spewed out as spaceships were launched at the baikonur space base in kazakhstan of russia has caused serious sicknesses in children in the surrounding neighborhood, but russian space agency denied this claim today.
citing a research study, the science journal nature published today said the levels of endocrine and blood diseases among residents in the polluted area are twice as high as that in normal areas.
the study was conducted by a group of russian scientists led by epidemiologist zykov.
russian space agency said in response: "no direct influence of space-related activities on the health of residents has been established."
the study cited by the science journal nature mainly studies the children in altai republic.
altai republic is located in the mountainous region on the fringes of siberia.
altai republic was chosen for the subject of the study because it was polluted by un-burnt fuel, hydrazine in particular.
some of russian space agency's launching missions used hydrazine as fuel for the initial few stages.
zykov compared the health records of some 1,000 children in two polluted areas during 1998 to 2000 with the health records of a control group's 3,300 children in nearby unpolluted areas.
the science journal nature reported that zykov concluded the ratio of medical care needed for children in the current most polluted area is nearly twice as much as that for the unpolluted control group.  the time needed for treatment is also twice as long.
iraqi election will be flawed, white house says
white house acknowledged today that the iraqi election slated for january 30 "is not going to be perfect."  meanwhile, two car bombing attacks took place again in mosul in iraq, killing at least two iraqi soldiers.
asked whether he agreed with iraqi prime minister allawi's remark that violence will make voting impossible in some areas in iraq, white house spokesman mcclellan said: "we all admit that this election is not going to be perfect."
he said: "this is the first time that iraqi people can freely choose their leaders.  this is an election for a transitional government, and also one of the three elections that are to take place this year."
mcclellan said: "so we will try our best to assist the iraqi people and the transitional government to ensure as many people as possible take part in this upcoming election."
bloody violence broke out in iraq on the 11th, killing at least 25 people, six of whom died in a car bombing attack in tikrit, the hometown of former president hussein.  under such circumstances, allawi admitted frankly that it would be impossible for some areas in iraq to participate in this month's election.
in the meantime, another two car bombing attacks took place today in mosul in iraq, leaving at least two iraqi soldiers dead.
us army sergeant schaeffer told afp that a van exploded in an attempt to attack on a joint convoy of us and iraqi military vehicles, killing an unidentified number of civilians.
schaeffer said another car parked across the street exploded and killed two iraqi soldiers.
us trade deficit in november hit us$60 billion, setting highest record in history
us department of commerce announced data today that us exports shrank 2.3% in november last year, driving trade deficit to a new historic high of us$60.3 billion.
while us exports plummeted to a new five-month low of only us$95.6 billion, imports grew 1.3% to a new all time high of us$155.8 billion as the bill for us oil imports increased by 1.3%, or more than us$2 billion to us$14.2 billion.
trade deficit increased 7.7% from the adjusted us$56 billion in october last year, a dramatic increase of 50.8% from the us$40 billion in november 2003.
according to a survey conducted by cbs marketwatch, wall street economists predicted the trade deficit on goods and services will shrink to about us$53.3 billion.
although a weaker dollar makes us products relatively cheaper both at home and abroad, the us trade deficit continues to widen.
the report by the department of commerce today will put pressure on the us dollar and renew calls for washington to do something about the us energy independence and the trade imbalance with china.
us exports slipped last november due to a decrease of us$1.4 billion in capital goods exports, including a us$325-million drop in aircraft and aircraft engines exports.
exports of industrial materials, mainly energy, fell by us$800 million.
exports of automobiles, consumer goods, and food also declined.
japan defense agency chief: will not forget militarist past and will respect the dignity of neighboring countries
japan defense agency chief yoshinori ono said today that japan will not forget its militarist past and will carefully keep in mind the "dignity" of neighboring countries as it takes a higher international profile.
asked about possible concern over japan's dispatch of its self-defense forces to areas hit by south asian tsunamis, ono said: "when we get along with southeast asian countries, we should never forget" the past.
he told reporters: "we must build a relationship with our friendly neighbors, which allows us to tell them we mean well.
looking back on the past, we should fully respect the dignity of other countries."
noting this year marks the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii, ono said: "we hope to be reborn and will cooperate for the new era."
ono has just concluded his tour of several countries hit by south asian tsunamis.  he said he could feel the "dignity" of an independent country  when the indonesian leader told him japan's self-defense forces should complete their relief mission by the end of march at the latest.
the united nations has expressed concern over the deadline the indonesian government imposed on foreign troops.
foreign troops were well credited for delivering relief to tsunami survivors in the most remote areas.
nearly 1,000 japan's sdf troops are on their way to the countries hit by the december 26 tsunami, a natural catastrophe that killed more than 163,000 people.
this is the largest deployment of japan's self-defense forces since the end of world war ii.
the us-directed japanese postwar constitution stipulates that the self-defense forces cannot use force.
controversy broke out in japan's media over alleged political interference in nhk program
the allegation that the public japan broadcasting corp(nhk) was pressured by politicians to delete part of a program on japan's military draft of women as sex slaves during world war ii a few years ago has pitted liberal japanese media against their conservative counterparts.
it was alleged that nhk took out most portions of interviews after its discussion with top political leaders.  liberal media criticized nhk for what it did since the majority of those interviewed were critics of japan's wartime conduct and victims of forced sex slavery.
however, conservative newspapers defended nhk's decision to edit the program, believing the company's senior executives were obligated to ensure the fairness of the program content.
the controversy broke out last week over a program aired in 2001 that featured a mock trial on the crime the japanese military committed in drafting women as sex slaves.
the trial, held by a women's rights group in tokyo in december 2000, found late japanese emperor hirohito guilty because he allowed japanese military to draft women as sex slaves during the japanese occupation of asian countries.
historian said at least 200,000 young women were forced to serve as sex slaves in frontline japanese military brothels during the war.  they were mostly from south korea but some of them also came from taiwan, china, philippines and indonesia.
the program producer satoru nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th to disclose the fact that right before the program was aired, nhk senior officials had met with the ruling liberal democratic party lawmakers shinzo abe and shoichi nakagawa, who had expressed concern over the program.
according to nagai, nhk senior officials later re-edited and shortened the program.
he said: "nhk bowed to political pressures."
abe and nakagawa admitted meeting with nhk officials and telling them to be "fair" but strongly denied pressuring the company.
eurozone data to show core inflation under control
economists said today that eurozone economic data to be released this week will show core inflation is still under control.
in the meantime, eurozone industrial production and french consumer spending are both expected to decline.
the eurostat is expected to confirm that inflation rate will rise slightly from 2.2% in november to 2.3% in december when it releases inflation data on the 20th of this month.
however, the increase is mainly a reflection of tobacco tax increases, and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%.
core inflation figures will be released together with consumer prices figures.
economists pointed out that core inflation, which excludes prices of food, energy, tobacco and alcohol, has stayed at the range of 1.6% and 2% for the past two years.
european central bank president trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have diminished recently.
although inflation will remain above 2% for the coming few months, it may decline by the end of the year.
meanwhile, another economist said that given the slowing growth in germany, eurozone industrial output expectations for november to be released on the 18th are also expected to decline.
german industrial output declined 1.7% in november, while a survey of economists conducted by afp's subsidiary afx news shows that eurozone industrial output will fall again by 0.4% in november after a drop of 0.5% in october.
schmieding of bank of america said that a rebound in eurozone industrial output expectations is likely in december.
tsunami victims hit anew, this time by bureaucracy
three weeks after suffering the strongest tsunami attacks in history, survivors are now grappling with the vices of bureaucracy and politicization, while the world's focus has shifted elsewhere.
thousands of decaying bodies continue to be dug out from debris, pushing the death toll of the december 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 168,000.  in the meantime, the upcoming iraqi presidential elections and bush's inauguration ceremony have replaced the tsunami disaster as the world media's top headline news.
indonesia has retracted its original demand that foreign troops involved in humanitarian aid missions withdraw within three months.
in thailand, leaders from canada, sweden, norway, and finland are discussing reconstruction and efforts to identify dead bodies.
however, survivors are facing new difficulties, such as indonesia's deep-rooted bureaucracy, which has impeded the distribution of relief supplies pouring in from all over the world.
in a small village near banda aceh, capital of aceh province on the indonesian island of sumatra, fisherman busriadi said: "it seems like we do not even exist.  the tsunami hit us very hard.  we have lost everything and we are starving."
he said: "where are the food, clothing, and other relief supplies we saw on tv pouring into aceh?"
like thousands of other disaster victims, busriadi lost his identity card and other official documents due to the tsunami, which turned his efforts to get relief supplies into a nightmare.
although he has been begging officials and shuttling daily from one place to another to process paperwork, the result is always the same: no relief aid for him.
zeng qinghong said to have visited zhao ziyang before his death
the hong kong-based information center for human rights and democracy in china said that before ousted former cpc secretary general zhao ziyang died of illness this morning, china's vice president zeng qinghong visited him in the hospital.
the information center said that according to zhao ziyang's family, zeng qinghong visited him at 6:00 this morning in a beijing hospital before his death about an hour later.  zhao was 85.
formerly cpc secretary general and premier, zhao ziyang was ousted because he opposed the military crackdown on the tiananmen square democratic movement in 1989.  he had been under house arrest since then and had lost favor within the government.
the information center said that according to zhao's family, wen jiabao, incumbent premier who used to work under zhao ziyang, did not come to visit him when he was critically ill.
however, before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th, he was visited by tian jiyun, the retired party central committee member who once worked as his assistant.
the information center for human rights and democracy in china has been in regular contact with the zhao family and has released accurate information about zhao ziyang at opportune times for many years.
the information center said that some twenty key retired officials from the party, the government, and the military plan to issue a public letter to the cpc calling for a reevaluation of zhao ziyang's contributions and demanding a public memorial service for him.
the center added that zhao ziyang's family will not receive permission to host or prepare a funeral.  the final decision on relevant arrangements will be made by the party.
liang boqi, zhao ziyang's wife, is 86.
the information center said that due to her poor health, she was not informed of her husband's death until the evening.
china widely urged to push for democracy in the wake of zhao ziyang's death
while the world lavished praise on former cpc leader zhao ziyang after his death from illness today, japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi, the taiwan government, and overseas chinese democracy campaigners all urged beijing to push for democratic reforms envisioned by zhao ziyang.
ousted in 1989 for his opposition toward the military crackdown on the tiananmen square democratic movement, zhao ziyang spent the rest of his life under house arrest and passed away in a beijing hospital this morning.  he was 85.
according to jiji press, japanese prime minister koizumi said in memory of zhao ziyang: "i hope they (china) make efforts toward democratization."
taiwan also urged china to push for democracy and political reforms after the death of zhao ziyang.
overseas chinese democracy campaigners praised zhao ziyang as "one of the greatest reformers in china" who sacrificed his political life in opposing the bloody crackdown on the tiananmen square democratic movement.
lian shengde, president of the new york-based free china movement and former student movement leader, said: "during the 15 years of his house arrest, he openly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward rule of law and democracy.
zhao ziyang will be fondly remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a man of principle."
some democracy activists are demanding that the chinese government hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and make a fair evaluation of his contributions.
however, they admit the unlikelihood of zhao ziyang receiving such treatment because of chinese government's fears that a public dissatisfied with the cpc ruling will take advantage of the occasion to create unrest.
as it was, the 1989 student movement was triggered by the death of reformist leader hu yaobang.
a brief report released by xinhua news agency today that comrade zhao ziyang had died of illness in beijing was the only related official statement.
un: rich nations fail to honor pledge to reduce poverty
a panel of un-appointed experts said in a new report that the rich nations that promised to deliver financial aid to halve extreme poverty worldwide by 2015 have so far failed to honor their pledge.
wealthy nations around the world have promised to participate in "millennium development goals," an ambitious un program, to improve the lot of the world's poor and suffering.
however, as more than one billion people worldwide are living on less than a dollar a day, and 2.7 billion more are surviving on less than two dollars a day, the un experts said there isn't much time left for rich nations to live up to their promises.
director brown of the un development program said: "with the right mobilization of resources and political will, and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries, these goals are still achievable."
the un experts said that 22 rich nations worldwide pledged to provide 0.7% of their gross national product in aid to the developing countries, but they have so far only provided 0.25%.
un secretary general annan commissioned the development experts led by former harvard economist sachsthe to compile this progress report on meeting the goals, which include wiping out extreme poverty, making primary education universal, cutting child mortality rate, and fighting aids and other deadly diseases.
the report said: "the practical solutions exist. the political framework is established.  and for the first time, the cost is affordable.  all that is needed now is action."
a global disaster warning system to be set up, un announces
the united nations announced that a global disaster warning system will be set up to prevent major natural disasters.
however, after south asia's massive tsunami tragedy, there are still differences on which country's technology is to be used for this disaster warning system.
in a joint statement issued after a global conference in kobe, japan, several un agencies said that un experts will establish a global disaster warning system to reduce damages caused by major natural disasters.
the severe damages caused by south asia's massive tsunamis infuriated all the indian ocean nations.
director briceno of the international strategy for disaster reduction said: "the new program will bring peace and safety to mankind.
an effective early warning system will ensure the lives and safety of millions of people in all parts of the world."
however, this un statement is largely symbolic only.
a unesco official said that many more important talks are needed on this disaster warning system.
the unesco is spearheading the establishment of a global disaster warning system.
bernal, head of unesco's intergovernmental oceanographic commission, said: "at present, several countries have made different proposals.  so we need to make coordination and cooperation efforts."
bernal said the commission will hold two meetings within 60 days, which hopefully can decide on one of the proposals about the tsunami warning system.
one of the meetings is to be held in paris, while the location for the other meeting has not yet been decided.
bernal hopes that a decision can be reached in july.  this global disaster warning system will be completed and put into operation by mid-2006, also the target timeline set by the unesco.
beijing's hiv cases rise 40% annually
xinhua news agency, beijing, december 1 (reporters zhao xinpei and li xu) beijing municipal health bureau recently released its latest statistics on hiv infections in beijing: from 1985 to october 2004, beijing reported a cumulative 2,046 cases of hiv infection, with an average annual increase of 40.6%.
according to national aids statistics, beijing ranks 8th in the country in number of reported hiv cases.
of the 2,046 hiv cases, 403 are beijing residents, 1,507 are non-resident migrants, 106 are foreign nationals, and 30 are people with unidentified addresses.
according to analysis, aids infection in beijing is mainly caused by intravenous drug abuse and sexual transmission.  aids infection within the migrant population is mainly caused by intravenous drug abuse and blood selling, while aids infection among foreign nationals is mainly sexually transmitted.
since july 2004, in order to prevent aids from spreading further, disease prevention and control centers in 18 districts and counties in beijing municipality have set up free aids consultation rooms and anti-body screening labs to conduct face-to-face consultations, preliminary blood screening, and epidemic surveys.  this practice will be gradually expanded to all hospitals above level 2 in the municipality.
beijing municipal health bureau has tapped ditan hospital and you'an hospital as beijing's designated hospitals for free aids treatment, responsible for the clinical part of treatment.  beijing municipal health bureau and the municipal finance bureau organize and integrate all purchases of necessary drugs and testing agents.
the beijing municipal education commission has researched and formulated a policy of free education for hiv-infected patients and their children and a school attendance policy for the hiv-infected among young students.
at present, beijing hospitals above level 2 with ob-gyn departments are responsible for providing free aids consultations and screening, while ditan hospital and you'an hospital perform anti-viral medical treatment for pregnant women.
at present, 1,390 condom vending machines have been installed free of charge in some areas; methadone maintenance treatment is provided for intravenous drug abusers, and trial locations for clean syringe exchange have also been established.
shanghai tops world in power generation equipment output and production capacity
xinhua news agency, shanghai, december 1 (reporter jiang wei) as trial operations were completed for a 660-mw generating unit, shanghai turbine generator co., ltd., a subsidiary of shanghai electric power generation group (secpg), on the 1st of this month fulfilled ahead of time its annual generator production capacity target of 15,000 mw, helping shanghai to rank first in the world in both power station equipment output and production capacity, a dream come true for generations of workers in china's equipment manufacturing industry.
secpg is china's largest power station equipment manufacturer.
as the demand for power generation equipment has soared in china in recent years, the country's power generator manufacturers have entered the stage of high growth and major development.
integrating its superior resources in power station equipment such as turbine generators and power station boilers, secpg obtained a production order for nine large-sized gas-fired generating units and three exhaust-heat boilers in a general bid, after taking an order for four 1,000-mw fuel-fired generating units.
in the meantime, it further enhanced its corporate management, technological development, and production efficiency through integrated operations.
at present, secpg commands 40% of the market in china's power station equipment industry, and continues to develop overseas markets in the middle east, southeast asia, south america, and other regions.
this year alone, shanghai turbine generator co., ltd., manufacturing principal components for power generation equipment, has taken in sales orders worth 6 billion yuan.
secpg president zheng jianhua said that the "power shortage" this summer triggered a dramatic nationwide increase in the demand for power station equipment, dramatically intensifying market competition for manufacturing power station equipment.
the group is now working toward its three major goals of "researching, developing, and manufacturing 1,000-mw fuel-fired generators, gas-fired turbine generating units, and 1,000-mw nuclear power generators" in an effort to be ranked in the global fortune 500 as soon as possible.
(hong kong, macao, taiwan) hong kong observatory provides new services for wmo websites
xinhua news agency, hong kong, december 2  beginning on the 2nd of this month, hong kong observatory will provide two new services for the websites of "world weather information service" and "severe weather information center" managed by the world meteorological organization.
the observatory spokesperson said the two new services are: adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the wwis website and adding a recap function to display the tropical cyclone tracks of the past seven days to the swic website.
these two services represent hong kong observatory's provision of yet another new service after it provided the global heavy rain (including snow) official observation data to the swic at the beginning of this year.
it is learned that the wwis website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for major world cities.
the new service provides, for the first time, global official weather observations with a global map of cloudiness and rain as a pilot program.
the new web page has a wide and intensive coverage of weather observation data and is updated regularly eight times a day.
the new product at the swic website provides a recap function for the tropical cyclone tracks.
in the previous design, the original locations and other information of each tropical cyclone were no longer saved on the website once it had dissipated.
however, there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about the tropical cyclone several days after it has made landfall.
therefore, the new product saves the information on the intensities, locations and tracks of all tropical cyclones that have occurred in the past seven days, allowing the public and the media to retrieve the needed information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated.
world's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus h5n1 developed in shantou
xinhua news agency, shantou, december 3 (zhang siwen and lin junqiang) reporters learned that the joint influenza research center, partnering the medical schools of shantou university and the university of hong kong, has developed the world's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus h5n1, following its nearly six months of work with xiamen university.
using this quick testing method to test a suspected case specimen can produce a conclusion about bird flu infection in as fast as one hour.
according to an introduction given by professor guan yi, head of the joint influenza research center of the shantou university and the university of hong kong medical schools, the highly pathogenic and deadly bird flu actually has a much higher mortality rate than the sars virus, based on current available data.
previously it took at least three to five days, and at times more than one week, to confirm the diagnosis of a "suspected" case of the virus.
this successfully developed quick technique for bird flu virus testing uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a gold-based dipstick.  specimens able to be tested include excretions, nasal or throat secretions, whole or split virus cultured in a chicken embryo, and serums.  a conclusion about bird flu infection can be reached in as fast as one hour, and at most within two hours.
the new technique is simple, convenient, and fast.  the test can be performed at the site of an outbreak with over 90% accuracy.  it can aid the early detection, diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of the infectious virus, and thereby prevent widespread outbreak and consequent heavy casualties.
entrusted by china's center of disease prevention and control, the joint influenza research center of the shantou university and the university of hong kong medical schools recently held a training workshop on bird flu virus testing and trained staff from centers of disease prevention and control in 20 provinces and cities throughout the country.  this latest bird flu quick testing technique was included as part of the program.
spokesperson for office of the special commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong expresses great dissatisfaction with speech of hyde, chairman of us house committee on international relations
xinhua news agency, hong kong, december 3  a spokesperson for the office of the special commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong spoke on the 3rd to express great dissatisfaction with the recent speech in hong kong by hyde, chairman of the us house committee on international relations.
the spokesperson expressed strong dissatisfaction with the speech delivered on the 2nd in hong kong by hyde, chairman of the us house committee on international relations, for his vicious attacks on development and progress in china and his cold war-style defiling of china's foreign policy.
the spokesperson said it is commonly known that china's development not only serves the basic interests of the 1.3 billion chinese people, but also supports worldwide prosperity and development.
on the international stage, china is a responsible nation and has played an active and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability.
on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation, china has always strictly observed relevant international conventions and firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form.  china maintains that such issues should be resolved through negotiation, dialogue, and strengthened international monitoring.
the spokesperson said that while china-us relations are making healthy and steady progress, it was regretful that mr. hyde ignored objective facts and made these extremely irresponsible remarks.  these remarks, totally inconsistent with consensus on the development of bilateral relations reached by chinese and us presidents recently, run counter to the mainstream voice of the us community for strengthened cooperation with china and are undoubtedly harmful to the development of the china-us relationship.
china's largest seawater desalinization project to be built in zhoushan
xinhua news agency, hangzhou, december 6 (pan yifeng and xu qun) the largest-ever mainland seawater desalinization project, with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons, is to be built in putuo district of zhoushan city, zhejiang province.
for zhoushan residents, who have long suffered from water shortage, the seawater that has surged around them for thousands of years will soon be turned into fresh, sweet running water flowing into tens of thousands of households.
reporters learned from relevant departments that the hangzhou water treatment technology development center under the state oceanic administration and liuheng township government of putuo district, zhoushan city have recently signed a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalinization project with daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons.
with daily production of 10,000 tons of fresh water, the 50-million-yuan seawater desalinization project would have the mainland's largest treatment capacity so far.  the project's first phase is expected to be completed by next year.
zhoushan is one of the cities in china with serious water shortages.
there are 1,390 islands of various sizes within the city.  fresh water per capita is 601 cubic meters, which is only 25.4% of the average fresh water per capita in zhejiang province.  water supply has always been a problem in the life of this island city's residents.
in putuo district's liuheng township for example, 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped daily from a neighboring town at the cost of more than ten yuan per ton.
the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization technology developed by the hangzhou water treatment technology development center under the state oceanic administration is a pressure-driven membrane separation process, currently a hot subject in international seawater desalinization research.
the relevant authority at the center said that through technological improvement and by retrofitting domestic-made equipment, both the costs of the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization project and its energy consumption have been reduced.
the cost of seawater desalinization treatment has been further reduced from 5 yuan per ton.
this reduction indicates that the cost of seawater desalinization may be expected to approach the prices of running water and industrial water.
(international) hungary's referendum on the 5th invalidated
xinhua news agency, budapest, december 5 (reporter liu weimin) on the 5th, hungary held a national referendum on the issues of privatization of national public medical institutions, and of dual citizenship for overseas ethnic hungarians.
since both the number of participating voters and the number of voters for or against the two issues failed to reach percentages set by law, results of this referendum were invalidated.
statistical results based on 99.91% of the vote, as calculated by hungary's national electoral office in the late evening of the 5th, showed that 3.011 million people, accounting for 37.48% of total voters in the country, participated in the voting.
among them, 1.919 million and 1.033 million voted for and against the first issue, respectively, accounting for 23.87% and 12.85% of eligible voters in the country.  1.518 million and 1.426 million voted for and against the second issue, respectively, accounting for 18.88% and 17.75% of eligible voters in the country.
according to relevant hungarian laws, only when the number of participating voters exceeds 50% of eligible voters in the country, or when the number of voters for or against the above issues exceeds 25% of eligible voters in the country, will the result of the referendum be valid.
previously, the hungarian government and the ruling party had been calling for people to vote against the aforementioned two issues, while the opposition party had been urging people to vote in favor.
it is reported that this referendum had the lowest voter turnout of all referendums and elections to date.
following release of the voting results, hungarian prime minister gyurcsany made a speech acknowledging the failure of this referendum.
he said the government will be more active in developing ethnic policies and conducting healthcare reform.
on the other hand, orban, chairman of the federation of young democrats, hungary's largest opposition party, said the referendum was beneficial even if the number of voters in favor did not reach the required percentage.
he urged the government and parliament to consider the results of this referendum while developing related legislation.

(international) special summit of the andean presidential council held in peru
xinhua news agency, cusco (peru) december 7 (reporters liu guoqiang and wang lu) the special summit of the presidential council of the andean community (can) opened on the 7th in cusco, a famous tourist city in peru.
participating presidents or their representatives will discuss such issues as deepening integration in the andean region and promoting economic and social development.
peruvian president toledo said at the summit's opening ceremony that although the andean community has been established for 35 years, some major issues such as poverty have still not yet been resolved.
currently, poverty rates in the andean region are as high as 53%, posing a serious threat to democratic administration in the region.
all governments in the andean community must therefore try hard to establish effective poverty reduction mechanisms and to increase levels of public participation in state affairs, so as to promote social stability and development.
toledo said that although there are many issues within the andean community that need to be resolved, great progress has been made in latin american integration in recent years.  the establishment of the south american community of nations will be declared at the third south american presidential summit to be held here on the 8th.
he said he believed the establishment of this new regional organization will play an important role in promoting political, economic, and social development in the region.
in addition to toledo, bolivian president mesa also attended the meeting.
colombian president uribe, ecuadorian president gutierrez, and venezuelan president chavez were unable to attend the meeting for various reasons, but they will come to attend the third south american presidential summit to be held here on the 8th.
established in 1969, the andean community is composed of five countries, namely bolivia, colombia, ecuador, venezuela, and peru.  it is a regional organization through which latin american countries promote economic cooperation.  the community is headquartered in the peruvian capital of lima.
the presidential council is the highest-level decision-making body of the andean community and holds a meeting every year.
the last meeting was held in the ecuadorian capital of quito in july 2003.
construction of three gorges project underground power station to begin soon
xinhua news agency, wuhan, december 8 (reporter shi yongfeng) on december 8, the first public bidding was held for the principal part of the yangtze three gorges project underground power station, kicking off construction of the three gorges underground power station.
the three gorges project design calls for the installation of 26 700-mw water turbine generating units, for a combined capacity of 18,200-mw, which upon completion will generate 84.7 billion kwh of electricity annually.
in order to further tap the power generation potential of the three gorges project, the preliminary design of the project reserved space for expanding the underground power station.
according to an executive with china yangtze river three gorges project development corporation, the three gorges underground power station is to be set in the mountain on the right bank of the three gorges dam, with its principal construction including intake tower, diversion tunnel, principal plant building, tailrace system, bus shaft, and 500kv transformer substation.
six 700-mw generating units will be installed in the underground power station.
thus, the total number of generating units installed in the three gorges project will be increased from the originally planned 26 to 32, while installed generation capacity will rise to 22,400-mw from 18,200-mw, significantly boosting the three gorges project power generation capacity.
flood control was the primary objective for construction of the three gorges project.
according to the three gorges reservoir operation coordination plan, the water level of the reservoir will be lowered from the normal pool level of 175 meters to the flood control level of 145 meters prior to the annual flood season.
therefore, construction of the underground power station will increase water utilization in the three gorges reservoir, reduce the amount of unused water, and enhance power generation capacity, maximizing the periods of peak calibration when no water goes unused.
currently, groundbreaking has already started for the branch tube, the tailrace, the support structure, and other preliminary projects for construction of the three gorges underground power station.
sources said that the underground power station will be completed and put into operation by the end of 2008.
china ready to establish a sailing festival
xinhua news agency, beijing, december 8 (reporter huang fuhui) yao mingde, chairman of the china road transport association, said at a press conference held here on the 8th that he is "full of confidence" for establishing a china sailing festival.
yao mingde, who also heads the organizing taskforce office for commemorating the 600th anniversary of zheng he's western seas voyage, said that 16 member departments of the organizing taskforce, including the ministry of communications, have reached consensus on establishing july 11 of each year, the day zheng he made his first western seas voyage, as china's sailing festival, and will make a proposal to the state for establishing this festival.
sources said the state council approval is needed to establish non-holiday festivals.
zheng he was a world-renowned navigator.
during the 28 years from 1405 to 1433, zheng he led a fleet of more than 200 ships and nearly 30,000 people on a succession of seven long sea voyages, sailing through southeast asia, the indian ocean to arrive at the red sea and africa.  his journey covered over 300,000 kilometers and included stops in more than 30 countries and regions in asia and africa.
china will host a series of events next year to commemorate the 600th anniversary of zheng he's western seas voyages.
the logo for the commemorative events was revealed in beijing on the 8th.
the logo comprises a sailboat braving the wind and waves as it sails west, a light blue billowy arching wave, and the text "600th anniversary of zheng he's western seas voyage (1405-2005)."
it was designed by yao ying, an art teacher in a junior high school in xi'an, shaanxi province.
people from all walks of life have urged that a china sailing festival be established in 2005 to coincide with the 600th anniversary of zheng he's western seas voyage, and to use the opportunity to educate youngsters, thus enhancing public awareness of sailing and maritime concepts, passing down the spirit of the chinese nation, and deepening patriotic education.
yao mingde said that china has over 3 million square meters of sea territory and that 90% of china's goods in the international trade is transported by sea.
as china is one of the world's large maritime nations, lack of a sailing festival among its various holidays does not make sense.
taiwan province has already established july 11 as sailing festival day.
sailing festivals are celebrated in about a dozen nations throughout the world, including the united states, canada, and japan.

the communiqu said that annan also stressed that all parties in cote d'ivoire should agree upon a "detailed action plan."
he also "placed great hopes" in continued efforts by south african president mbeki and the african union to resolve the cote d'ivoire crisis in close cooperation with the economic community of west african states (ecowas) and unoci.
on behalf of the african union, mbeki paid a four-day visit to cote d'ivoire from the 2nd to the 6th of this month, seeking to develop a plan to resolve the crisis there.
at the conclusion of his visit, mbeki announced that all parties in cote d'ivoire had reached consensus on four proposals.
the proposals include completing the relevant legislation of the marcoussis agreement, starting a process for disarming combat personnel, returning all government ministers to their posts to take their duties, and restoring cote d'ivoire's domestic security.
the ivorian parliamentary caucus chairman recently held a meeting and decided that parliament will start reviewing the draft for constitutional reforms on the 10th.
ivorian opposition rebels also announced on the 8th that opposition leaders will hold a meeting in the coming days to evaluate the overall peace process and to discuss the issue of disarmament.
in september 2002, a coup and civil war broke out in cote d'ivoire.
in january last year and july of this year, major ivorian political parties and representatives of opposition rebels reached agreements in france and ghana, respectively, to restore peace and carry out national reconciliation.
however, implementation of the agreements suffered numerous setbacks, repeatedly stalling the peace process.
opposition rebels, who control the northern part of cote d'ivoire, recalled their government representatives in mid-october, leaving the country's peace process in another deadlock.
the situation in cote d'ivoire further worsened in early november when the ivorian government army had a serious clash with french troops stationed in the country.

xinhua news agency, nanning, december 11 (reporter wang mian) on december 11, the old revolutionary base of baise, population 3.6 million, commemorated the 75th anniversary of the baise uprising with a series of activities.
on december 11, 1929, deng xiaoping, zhang yunyi, and others launched and directed the famous baise uprising and founded the revolutionary base of youjiang and the 7th army of the chinese workers and peasants red army.
the baise uprising, following the nanchang uprising, the autumn harvest uprising, and the guangzhou uprising, was yet another successful armed uprising led independently by the communist party.
on the morning of december 11, more than 2,000 people holding fresh flowers came to the baise uprising monument to lay their flowers, bow in respect, and reminisce upon the martyrs' great achievements.
after that, they watched the movie "baise uprising" and toured the photo and picture exhibit "zhang yunyi in guangxi," in addition to other activities.
huang qunsheng, a student of baise high school, said: "although we are frequently told a lot about patriotism and collectivism in our history classes and social and political science classes, we feel that today's actual on-site visit has given us a vivid lesson about patriotism."
since this year's centennial birthday celebration of deng xiaoping, the old revolutionary base of baise has made a series of improvements to this foundation of patriotic education, including renovating the baise uprising museum facilities, constructing a garden of stone tablets engraved with deng xiaoping's handwriting, and preserving the yuedong guildhall, the original headquarters site of the 7th army of the chinese workers and peasants red army.

experts propose establishing a media spokesperson system for chinese youth
xinhua news agency, shanghai, december 13 (reporter liu dan) the "china youth social education forum 2004: media and development of minors," which concluded in shanghai on the 13th, proposed that china should establish a media spokesperson system regarding the status of minors, and regularly release information on existing problems and current development of the youth population.
relevant agencies in shanghai recently conducted a survey showing that a minor spends an average of 1.17 hours per day doing extracurricular reading, 1.05 hours watching tv, 0.99 hours surfing the internet, etc.  about half of a minor's free time is spent in a media environment, which, as an entirely new social force, is becoming an indismissible factor in shaping the growth and development of the youth population.
"media is a window that links the minds of youth with the outside world.  when the window is open, fresh air comes in along with flies and mosquitoes."
chen tianqiao, chairman of the board of shanghai shanda networking development co., ltd. said.
while media creates a good condition for the healthy growth of minors, opinions expressed in the media, due to market competition, demand for profits, and the poor nature of some media professionals, tend to mislead youngsters' thoughts and values.  some media even go further by serving as channels for violence and pornography.
at present, china has over 2,000 tv channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies.  there are 1,868 broadcast programs, and nationwide, as many as 87 million netizens.
relevant authorities at the forum said that establishing a media spokesperson system for minors could provide authoritative survey data on the current status and problems regarding youth development, change the present situation where the media "send wrong messages," and ensure a healthy and beneficial media environment for young people's growth.
(international) iraqi foreign minister thinks iraqi elections face three major challenges
xinhua news agency, dubai (the uae), december 14 (reporters xing xudong and yan yi) foreign minister zebari of the interim iraqi government said on the 14th in dubai that the iraqi elections set for january 30 next year will face three major challenges, namely a deteriorating security situation impeding and interfering with the election process; a turnout affected by voters too scared of terrorist attacks to vote; and ensuring to the largest extent possible transparency and fairness of the elections.
zebari said in a speech at the arab strategy forum in dubai that it is essential for iraq to hold elections as scheduled because the elections can not only determine a new iraqi leadership but also ensure that iraq is a free, democratic, and unified country belonging to the entire iraqi people.
he said he believed that the future iraqi government will be a legitimate government representing the iraqi people and expressing their wishes.
zebari said it is at iraq's request that us-led coalition forces are staying in iraq to provide protection, because the current interim iraqi government cannot control the security situation and is in no position to round up terrorists and saboteurs.
the coalition forces' stay is provisional and will, according to the un resolution, come to an end when iraq consummates its political processes and forms a legitimate government.
zebari stressed that the new iraq will continue to maintain its arab and islamic character and will abide by the charter of the league of arab states.
the iraqi people are faced with a historic opportunity to rebuild their country on a new foundation.  iraq will rise anew and become a major member in the big arab family capable of contributing to its own nation.

(international) worldwide drug-related deaths will increase in 2005, un warns
xinhua news agency, vienna, december 17 (reporter song guocheng) costa, executive director of the un office on drugs and crime (unodc), warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased production of heroin in afghanistan, the expected price stability and enhanced purity of heroin in the global black market in 2005 will result in more drug-related deaths.
costa has already sent warnings to health and anti-drug agency officials in europe and neighboring countries, urging these nations to closely watch new developments in afghan opium cultivation and international drug crimes, and to take corresponding prevention measures.
according to statistical data provided by the vienna-based unodc, the production of heroin in afghanistan dropped by 94% when opium cultivation was banned there in 2001.  the following year, the purity of heroin on the european black market declined by 50%.
from 2000 to 2002, the number of drug-related deaths in europe decreased by 20%.
costa said that compared with 2003, the area of opium cultivation in afghanistan this year has increased by 64%.  the production of heroin reached more than 500 tons, more than the total amount transacted in the global heroin black market in a year.  this trend indicates an increase in the purity of drugs worldwide and a commensurate increase in the number of drug-related deaths.
costa thinks that the source of drugs in afghanistan constitutes a "clear and realistic threat" to global anti-drug efforts, and that the increased supply of black market heroin is a "death sentence" for drug abusers.
it is estimated that there are about 100,000 deaths from drug overdose worldwide each year.
(international) us military confirmed another guantanamo prisoner as non enemy combatant
xinhua news agency, washington, december 20 (reporters pan yunzhao and tan xinmu) gordon england, navy secretary of the us department of defense, said at a press conference at the pentagon on the 20th that a military review team has confirmed that a prisoner detained at the us navy base in guantanamo was not an enemy combatant and will be released soon.
this is the second prisoner detained at guantanamo who was identified by the us military as not being an enemy combatant.
england said the pentagon verified the identity of this prisoner one or two days ago and that the state department will notify the home country of the prisoner of this decision and make arrangements for his release.
however, he did not reveal the name and nationality of this prisoner nor did he explain under what circumstances he was captured.
england refused to admit that the department of defense made any mistake in verifying the identities of guantanamo prisoners.
he said the military review team in charge of verifying the identities of guantanamo prisoners has reviewed 507 prisoners and confirmed the identities of 230, of whom 228 were proved to be enemy combatants.
the united states has so far released about 200 guantanamo prisoners.  some of them were freed after they were deported to their own countries, while a few of them continued to be detained after they returned to their countries.  at least twelve, however, again joined in attacking the us troops after being freed.
currently some 550 "al-qaeda" and taliban suspects are detained in the us navy base in guantanamo.  most of them were captured during the us war on afghanistan.
the us government claimed these people are enemy combatants instead of war prisoners and are therefore not entitled to the protection under "geneva convention."
many countries criticized the us government for detaining their nationals indefinitely, while some international organizations also criticized what the us government did as violation of the international law.
shanghai chosen for cctld node
xinhua news agency, shanghai, december 21 (feng yizhen and chen haiyu) on the 21st, the china internet network information center (cnnic) and shanghai information industry (group) co., ltd. signed an agreement on a shanghai node for country code top-level domain names.
domain names form the communication basis of all internet applications, including electronic commerce and administration, and are currently used extensively as internet website addresses.
when people visit websites and receive and send emails, they first need to input domain names.  through domain name system analysis, domain names are converted to ip addresses, which lead to the web host for information transmission.
domain name systems resemble a "nerve system" controlling information transmission on the internet.
according to an introduction by mao wei, director of the cnnic, which manages china's cctld system, the number of netizens in china currently exceeds 90 million, ranking second in the world, and the number of websites in china has topped 650,000.
domain name analysis volume is in direct proportion to use of the internet.  with the internet's rapid development, the volume of domain name analysis has also grown rapidly.
at present, the number of registered cn domain names has reached 430,000, and is growing by 10,000 each month.
the cctld server operated and managed by the cnnic processes 380 million applications for domain name analysis daily at an average rate of more than 4,400 per second and over 8,000 at peak times.
faced with rapid development of the internet, the cnnic, which administers and manages the registration of china's domain names, this year reevaluated china's four original cctld nodes and redeployed the cn tld nodes according to the reevaluation analysis.
based on the level of local internet development and the quality of connection service provider software and hardware, shanghai has been chosen as the cctld node.
sources said that shanghai currently hosts 45,000 cn domain names and that 26.6% of its population have internet access.  both internet accessibility and application ranked first in the country.
the eastern china region around shanghai, with a similarly advanced level of development, hosts 130,000 cn domain names and 230,000 websites.
therefore, shanghai has been selected as the first node in the redeployment plan.
china has become the world's largest producer of hard alloy
xinhua news agency, nanchang, december 22 (reporters yang yuanyuan and li xingwen) in recent years china has seen rapid development in its hard alloy industry, with an annual output exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy production.  in terms of production scale and capacity, china has become the largest producer of hard alloy in the world.  offering a full range of selection, china is capable of producing nearly all kinds of hard alloy products.
reporters learned this information on the 22nd at the china ganzhou tungsten industry development strategy forum currently underway.
hard alloy, known as "industrial teeth," is used to make cutting tools, high pressure tools, and mining and road construction machinery due to its extreme hardness and wear resistance.  hard alloy industry development plays an important role in the development of the entire tungsten industry.
sources said that china's hard alloy industry, beginning from scratch in the 1950s, has grown steadily toward its current status through remarkable achievements.
in the early 1980s when the annual worldwide hard alloy output was 25,000 tons, china produced about 5,000 tons of hard alloy per year.  entering the 21st century, annual global hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons, while china's hard alloy production has soared to 15,000 tons, exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy output.
china has also made significant progress in exporting hard alloy.
in 1986, china exported only 100 tons of hard alloy annually.  by 2003, exports had reached 2,500 tons.  this year's exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for one third of hard alloy market transactions worldwide, similar to china's share of total worldwide production.  foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports increased from less than us$4 million annually in the past to us$70 million today.
adb loan supports power generation using cbm and cmm in shanxi
xinhua news agency, beijing, december 23 (reporter jiang guocheng) the reporter learned on the 23rd from the china representative office of the asian development bank (adb) of the bank's recent approval of a us$117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern shanxi province fired by methane released from coal mining.
the cbm (coal bed methane) development demonstration project will use the latest technology to increase production of cbm and cmm (coal mine methane) to provide fuel for the 120-mw power plant to be constructed.
according to the plans, the project will provide at least 166 million cubic meters of cbm annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial, and commercial customers upon its completion in 2008.
it will benefit about 410,000 people in the area of jincheng.
shanxi's coal output accounts for one third of the nation's total.
the project's total cost is estimated at us$237 million, of which us$20 million will be provided by a loan from the japan bank for international cooperation, and us$37.86 million will be provided by a loan from china construction bank.
the jincheng municipal government and two mining/industrial corporations in the area will provide a total of us$61.24 million in equity capital.
the us trade and development agency has also provided a us$500,000 grant for the project.
methane recovered by drilling into a coal seam from the earth surface after completing construction of a mine well is called cbm, while methane released during underground coal mining operations is called cmm.
a highly explosive gas, methane must be removed in advance of coal mining operations to ensure a safe work environment.
removing, collecting, and utilizing methane will reduce greenhouse emissions and help slow global warming and climatic change.
the greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide.
replacement of coal with methane can also increase clean fuel usage, improve coal mine efficiency, and improve air cleanness.
hassing, an adb senior project expert, said the project is expected to account for about 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gas emission reduction quotas.
(international) israel museum's prized possession found to be a forgery
xinhua news agency, jerusalem, december 24  james snyder, director of the israel museum, said on the 24th that the museum's prized possession, the ivory pomegranate, has recently been identified as a forgery.
this ivory pomegranate was once considered the only artifact ever discovered of the first temple in solomon's time.
snyder said in a statement that israeli authorities conducted a meticulous examination on the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate.
experts found it should be a relic of the bronze period, dating back much earlier than the time of the first jewish temple.
a line of hebrew inscription on the pomegranate read: "belonging to the temple of the lord (yahweh), holy to the priests."
however, the inscription was identified as being later added.
the israel museum bought the ivory pomegranate from an anonymous collector for us$550,000 in the 1980s.
archeologists and artifact experts used to believe it was a treasure embedded by the first temple priest in the top of a scepter and also the only relic left from that period of time.
snyder said that prior to the purchase, the ivory pomegranate was authenticated by the israeli archaeologist nahman avigad and other experts.
according to the report by israel's newspaper haaretz, avigad ran a cursory examination of the relic using only a magnifying glass at that time.
avigad himself denied this allegation.
in recent months, israeli police uncovered three large-scale antiquity frauds in succession and questioned hundreds of people.
during the investigations, the police and the antiquities authority discovered by chance that the ivory pomegranate was a forgery.
the police will indict some of the parties involved next week.
in the 10th century b.c., the jewish king solomon built the first temple on today's temple mount to store the sacred objects like the ark of the covenant and noah's ark, which were later destroyed.
shenzhen to mandate use of "reclaimed water" in some complexes and residential subdistricts
xinhua news agency, guangzhou, december 26  in a major effort toward building a "water-saving" city, shenzhen will mandate the use of "reclaimed water" in some comparatively large complexes and residential subdistricts.  relevant guidelines and regulations on water reclamation design are currently being formulated.
"reclaimed water" mainly refers to non-drinking water derived from treated urban waste water and domestic sewage, meeting certain water quality standards and reusable within a certain range.
its quality is between that of running water and sewage.
in general it is used in large volume for flushing toilets, irrigating gardens and farmland, cleaning roads, washing cars, providing water for city fountains, and as supplementary water for cooling equipment.
according to an investigation by the shenzhen municipal water administration, more than 70 complexes in shenzhen were equipped with "reclaimed water" recycling systems during the mid-1990s, but the construction firms had to abandon their use due to the high costs of recycling and utilizing "reclaimed water" associated with the technology, design, and management.
to put these pipelines into actual use, it needs only an additional investment of 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan to install a "reclaimed water" treatment system.
based on daily usage of 500 tons of "reclaimed water" by each residential subdistrict, shenzhen could save 35,000 tons of running water per day using the 70-plus existing sets of "reclaimed water" pipelines.
sources said that shenzhen's "reclaimed water" recycling project will start with the renovation of the 70-plus complexes that were originally equipped with "reclaimed water" recycling systems.  further promotion will be based on assessment of feedbacks.
in the meantime, the shenzhen municipal water administration will work with city planning and construction departments to develop guidelines as soon as possible for water reclamation design and to mandate the use of "reclaimed water" in some comparatively large complexes.
the treated "reclaimed water" will be first used to irrigate urban greenery.
27 tourists from zhejiang survived tsunami

(international) auctioned yugansk assets not to be incorporated into gazprom
xinhua news agency, moscow, december 30 (reporter song shiyi) medvedev, director of russia's presidential office and gazprom board chairman, spoke to the media on the 30th that gazprom will merge with rosneft in january next year as scheduled, but the assets of yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary of the oil firm yukos, which rosneft acquired, will not be incorporated into gazprom's corporate assets.
it is also reported that while talking about the reason why the auctioned yugansk assets will not be incorporated into gazprom's corporate assets, russia's industry and energy minister khristenko said on the same day that it was largely because the state is already the major shareholder of gazprom and does not want to add more to its controlling shares.
he said the yugansk assets will be separated individually and transferred to a completely state-owned company.
on the 19th of this month, russia's federal property fund held a public auction of 76.97% equity of yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary of the oil firm yukos.  the newly organized baikalfinansgroup won the bid with us$9.35 billion.
on the 22nd, the state-run rosneft announced its acquisition of baikalfinansgroup who won the bid for yugansk shares and became the new owner of yugansk shares.
analysts think one important reason for russia's skillful operation of the yugansk assets auction is to gain a dominant position in the related legal dispute.
in september this year, russian president putin had approved the merger of gazprom with rosneft.
gazprom, established in february 1993, is the largest natural gas producing company in the world.
the company controls 65% of russia's natural gas reserve.
last year the company's natural gas output accounted for 93% of russia's natural gas output and 20% of the world's natural gas output.

in an interview with this newspaper's reporter, the head of the fishery association of chennai said on the 31st that even if boats are repaired, fishermen won't dare go to sea in the coming months because they had witnessed firsthand the devastation and cruelty of the ocean.
some lost loved ones, while others suffered property damage.  the horror in their minds will last for a long time.
it is estimated that the state's fishing output in 2005 will drop by about 30% from 2004.
with the majority of its seaside fishing villages affected by the tsunami disaster on the 26th, the state of tamil nadu was the worst-hit region in india.
as of the 30th, more than 6,230 in the state had died, most of whom were fishermen.

(hong kong, macao, taiwan) hong kong economy to grow about 6% in 2005, research institute projects
xinhua news agency, hong kong, january 11 (reporter su xiao) the center for asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) studies at the university of hong kong said on the 11th that with the global economic environment still favorable, hong kong's economy is expected to grow about 6% this year, and 4.4% on an annual basis in the first quarter.
yue-chim wong, director of the center for apec studies at the university of hong kong, said at the "hong kong macroeconomic forecast" release that although interest rates this year are expected to rise and economic growth of hong kong's major trading partners will slow down, with the us and chinese economies expected to grow 3.6% and 8.5% respectively, the global economic environment in 2005 is still positive.
he said the center projects that hong kong's economy will maintain growth of about 6% in 2005, while consumer prices will rise 3% by the end of the year.
labor market adjustments will remain slow.  the unemployment rate will adjust slightly to about 6.3% by the end of the year.
uncertainty triggered by fluctuating global oil prices will remain the major factor clouding hong kong's economy.
shao qifa, the center's deputy director, said that economic growth momentum will slow in the first quarter this year, with total local output growing by 4.4%.  the growth slowdown reflects hong kong's weakening external demand caused by further slowdown in economic growth among hong kong's major trading partners.
according to reports, hong kong's total output in real terms would record a robust growth of 8% in 2004, as average consumer price levels declined by a mere 0.5%, with deflation disappearing in the third quarter of last year.
zhou yiqing, chairman of the preparatory committee for hong kong university's "hong kong macroeconomic forecast," said that hong kong's strong economic growth in 2004 mainly reflects the stable foundations of the local economy and strong competitiveness in foreign trade markets.  hong kong benefited from robust global economic growth and rapid growth in the mainland economy last year, while the end of deflation also allowed business owners to enjoy more cash flow.

these seven "regulations" will be implemented on a trial basis in the two months of the spring festival season before their official simultaneous enforcement begins on march 24, 2005.
bahraini princess marries a u.s. soldier; astounding marriage dissolves in 5 years
u.s. television stations had once feted the marriage between bahraini princess meriam al-khalifa and u.s. marine johnson. however, after just five years, this star-crossed marriage has already come to an end in the desert casino city of las vegas.
meriam is a member of the royal family of the gulf country of bahrain. johnson risked his military career over this forbidden love affair. their fairy-tale marriage was once the theme of a television movie.
nonetheless, according to the las vegas review journal, only five years later, the couple went to court when meriam filed for divorce in las vegas, where getting married is quick but getting divorced is quicker.
the two met in 1999, when johnson was still a career military man stationed in bahrain.
after he met this teenage princess, the pair fell in love and his life thus changed tremendously.
since the royal family forbade the union of these two young lovers, johnson smuggled meriam out of her country and into the united states by disguising her in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap, and forging her military identification papers.
after fighting a difficult immigration battle with the u.s. authorities, the couple was finally married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the las vegas strip, famous for its opulence. at that time, johnson was 23, and the bride was only 19.
however, johnson stated that because of the many temptations in las vegas, so-called "sin city," the continuous tensions between him and meriam's rich and powerful family, and the rumor of plots to assassinate him, this marriage, which had endured all kinds of hardships, finally dissolved.
johnson said that he worked as a parking valet for hotel and casino guests, while meriam gradually got sucked into the nightlife of the casino city. she frequented nightclubs late at night and ignored her husband.
meriam left her husband a year ago.
johnson said, "she's gone off the deep end."
this week's eurozone indicators shows a continually weak european economy
economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by eurozone this week would provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while british data is expected to show a growth in industrial activities.
they said that economic output data from the largest eurozone countries will continue to show great volatility every month, but the long-term trend will demonstrate a slow down in economic growth.
this week's key figures will be in germany. the closely watched economic expectations index, which is expected to be released on the 7th by the zew economic institute, will provide the first evidence of december's economic confidence in europe.
the zew index plummeted to 13.9 in november from 31.3 in the previous month.
in a recent survey, economists indicated that the substantial appreciation of the euro will continue to affect economic confidence, thus there is no reason to anticipate a rebound in the economic expectations index.
a bnp economist said, "given that the main factors negatively affecting economic confidence - the appreciation of the euro, uncertainty over global growth, and the weak labor market and increasing unemployment in germany - have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the december survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely."
according to a survey conducted by afx news, the afp financial news subsidiary, economists believed that this index would drop again to 11 in december from 13.9 in the prior month.
nevertheless, teather of ubs investment bank said that the zew economic expectations index of germany might even fall to zero in december.
teather said, "according to our view, expectations of future german economic activity, as reflected in the zew survey of analysts and financial market participants, will continue to fall."
ukrainian crisis creates east-west tensions; expected to be on osce meeting agenda
russia has repeatedly accused the west of interfering in eastern european affairs. the issue has become the focus of attention due to the political crisis in ukraine. it will also be at the top of the agenda of tomorrow's annual ministers meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce).
the creeping western influence into corners of europe previously considered by russia as its backyard, such as the baltic states, georgia, and central asia, has long disgruntled russia. thus, recent incidents in ukraine will probably dominate the two-day osce meeting to be held in sofia, the capital city of bulgaria.
the supreme court of ukraine has made the dramatic decision to order a rerun of the recent runoff of the presidential election. prior to that, the european union has already appealed to the osce member states to prepare their observers to "take action as quickly and efficiently as possible."
europeans revealed that the number of observers dispatched by osce to the election rerun in ukraine scheduled to be held on december 26 would increase from the original 600 to 1,000.
u.s. secretary of state powell will attend this osce annual meeting, which may be his last foreign visit before leaving office.
russian foreign minister lavrov, french foreign minister barnier, british foreign secretary straw, and german foreign minister fischer will also attend the meeting.
members of osce include 55 nations in north america, europe, and asia. the organization will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year.
the organization was established at the helsinki conference that very year and contributed to the ending of the cold war.
congress' vote on intelligence overhaul bill this week a crucial test for bush
the u.s. congress will push hard to pass the intelligence overhaul bill this week. the bill is an ambitious second-term agenda for republican president bush. his support among the republican congressmen will face its first major test after his reelection.
kean, the former republican new jersey governor responsible for the investigation of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september 11, 2001, said during an interview with the press that the issue of the intelligence overhaul bill is that congress has to approve it. this matter alone presents unfavorable signs for future cooperation between the two parties and the president's domestic policies.
kean said, "congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and congress can't get these big issues taken care of, and then we're all in trouble."
he told the new york daily news, "it'll be a long time before there's another bill with the support of the republican and democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80 percent of the american people in the polls."
several congressmen stated yesterday that if this groundbreaking reform bill failed, it would delay the overhaul of the u.s. antiquated intelligence network for months, years, or even kill its existence entirely.
harman, ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee, stated on cnn, "if the bill isn't passed this week, it dies."
the congress will try to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 again on the 6th and the 7th. it will then adjourn until next year.
if it is vetoed, the bill will be annulled and the congress will rewrite a new bill in the 2005 session.
ukrainian opposition party firmly rejects constitutional-reform bill that drastically curbs presidential power
the pro-western opposition party in ukraine today insisted that it would not accept the constitutional amendments advanced by outgoing president kuchma before the rerun of the presidential election.
this constitutional reform will strip most of the power currently held by the president.
after the supreme court annulled the results of the rigged runoff election held on november 21, the central election commission ordered a rerun on december 26. opposition leader yushchenko is again at loggerheads with kuchma.
tymoshenko, yushchenko's ally, stated, "if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form, all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament. this would be unacceptable."
she told reporters, "we hope that the president could appoint the chief of the intelligence bureau and the prosecutor-general so we can fight corruption and eliminate groups that control ukrainian politics and business circles."
due to his worry that the opposition party may win in the presidential election, kuchma, who has close ties with russia, advanced the constitutional reform ahead of the reelection.
yesterday, opposition party members in the parliament refused to vote on the constitutional-reform bill put forward by the government. as a result, the parliament will recess for 10 days.
according to the constitutional amendment bill, the authority to appoint all top officials except the prime minister, the defense minister, and the foreign minister will be transferred from the hand of the president to the parliament, in which pro-government forces currently have a close majority.
according to the constitutional amendment bill, the appointment of the prime minister, defense minister, and foreign minster by the president have to be approved by the parliament, while the parliament can also name their own candidates.
third week of ukrainian political crisis; opposition party calls for a continuous resistance
the chaos sparked off by the presidential election in ukraine has entered its third week. opposition leader yushchenko called on his supporters to continue their street protests and their blockade of the presidential palace and government buildings, until outgoing president kushma fires prime minister yanukovych and his cabinet, and to take actions to ensure justice in the upcoming rerun of the presidential runoff election.
tens of thousands of yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital city of kiev for two weeks. they surround government buildings and camp out on major roads designed by russian specialists for viewing military marches. their demonstration of the power of the masses has forced the supreme court to declare the presidential election on november 21 invalid. the central election commission ordered a new election on december 26 and the parliament has approved the dismissal of yanukovych. however, kushma still has not signed the administrative order to replace the successor, whom he fostered personally.
yushchenko told the supporters gathered at the independence square tonight that kushma should replace his government and reshuffle the central election commission, and that both the parliament and kushma should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent any electoral fraud.
in his speech that unveiled the runoff on december 26, he stated, "before these decisions are implemented, we should not discuss lifting the blockade of government buildings and the presidential palace.
during these 2 weeks, this square has demonstrated its ardent love for ukraine, and the civil awareness of tens of millions of ukrainians who can defend their choices."
he stated, "we are going through a struggle between the good and evil powers. the whole world is cheering for our victory and the entire world is proud of ukraine."
while the opposition party exerts more pressure on the governing authorities backed by moscow, and yushchenko and kushma are at a deadlock once again on constitutional reform, polish president kwasniewski, lithuanian president adamkus, and russian envoy gryzlov are scheduled to arrive in kiev on the 6th for another effort at mediation.
egypt announces breakthrough in middle east peace predicament
egypt stated that a new structure is anticipated for the middle east peace agreement.
it also said that it might dispatch an ambassador to israel again in the near future to resume full diplomatic relations, which have been severed for four years.
the state-run middle east news agency in egypt cited "senior" egyptian figures as saying that all parties seeking a peace plan are gradually coming to a consensus regarding the overall reconciliation.
the middle east news agency stated, "egypt, israel, palestine, and important international entities such as the united states and the european union have reached an important understanding and have agreed in principle to resolve the israel-palestine clashes completely."
since the death of palestinian strongman arafat last month, the international community resumes the advancement of the middle east peace policy, hoping to end prolonged bloodshed between israel and palestine as soon as possible.
the middle east news agency reported that officials expect "the preparation work will continue until july and political action will be taken afterwards."
the middle east news agency indicated that afterwards, parties that are concerned about the middle east peace progress, including israel, palestine, egypt, the united states, russia, and a few european countries, would hold a meeting in washington.
it is expected that the agenda for the meeting will include a "ceasefire on both sides," and palestinian authorities will "stop anti-israeli attacks and strengthen its control on the gaza strip and west bank."
in regards to this, the middle east news agency reported that israeli prime minister sharon promised, "as long as palestinian authorities honor the armistice agreement and have control over their territories, israel will stop its military action on the palestinians."
over 1 billion children worldwide suffer from war, poverty, and hiv/aids
an annual report published by unicef today shows that over 1 billion children, half of the world's children, suffer from poverty, war, and hiv/aids.
unicef pointed out that the rights of children to have a healthy and protected upbringing stated clearly in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child are frequently denied, partly because of governments' failure to implement human rights and economic reforms.
during the launch of the annual report in london, unicef executive director bellamy pointed out, "when half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets and whole villages are being emptied by aids, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood."
bellamy added, "too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually will hurt childhood."
data compiled jointly by researchers at unicef, the london school of economics, and bristol university reveals a gruesome picture of children in dangerous situations in most parts of the world.
researchers discovered that about 640 million children worldwide lack proper shelter, 400 million children do not have access to safe drinking water, 270 million children do not have health care services, and 140 million children (mostly girls) have never attended school.
researchers pointed out that a more serious fact is that at least 700 million children suffer from all forms of "extreme deprivation," including lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities.
the 10th annual report released by unicef today indicates that wars and hiv/aids have destroyed all the networks that are usually able to protect children. moreover, children are often the direct victims of wars and hiv/aids.
eu resists chinese pressure to lift arms embargo
the european union today rejected pressure from chinese premier wen jiabao for a quick end of the arms embargo on china. however, it also indicated that it would strive toward lifting this 15-year-old embargo.
the netherlands, the eu rotating presidency, made the above statement after the sino-eu summit.
the netherlands stated that how eu will end this embargo should not be wildly speculated.
the eu imposed the arms embargo on beijing after the 1989 tiananmen square massacre.
even though the arms embargo issue had cast a shadow over the sino-eu summit, the two sides still signed a number of trade and other agreements.
both china and the eu claimed that these agreements have strengthened their "strategic partnership."
in a joint declaration released after the summit with chinese premier wen jiabao, the eu stated, "the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo."
the declaration stated that the chinese delegate "welcomed the positive sign and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu."
wen jiabao did not hide his displeasure at the press conference after the summit. he said that this embargo "does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu."
wen jiabao stated, "the embargo is a product of the cold war. it neither reflects the current situation nor the partnership between china and the eu."
some eu nations, spearheaded by france, encouraged the lifting of this arms embargo, stating that it is out-dated.
without the amendment and strengthening of eu's related laws, critics worry that the lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates for arms sales and boost china's military strength.
balkenende, prime minister of the netherlands, claimed, "i explained that within the eu there is a willingness to lift the embargo, but i also explained that this is related to adjusting the code of conduct on arms exports."
preliminary findings: possible link of folic acid to breast cancer, but results inconclusive
a recent health study suggests that a b vitamin (folic acid) commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects may increase the chance of breast cancer.
nonetheless, researchers stated that their results might be a chance finding, because other research suggests that folic acid will in fact lower the risk of breast cancer. thus, they advised pregnant women to continue taking this supplement.
folic acid naturally exists in dark green vegetables and it is already known in medical circles that this is an important aid in the development of the fetus.
researchers from the university of bristol and the university of aberdeen in britain followed 3,000 women who had taken 5 mg or 0.2 mg dose of folic acid or a placebo, mostly during their second and third trimesters of pregnancies in the 1960s.
this research, published in the british medical journal, showed that by september 2002, those who had taken 5 mg doses of folic acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as those who took only the placebo.
ness, one of the researchers, stressed that these results present "preliminary findings that are intended to point the way toward further research."
he stated, "it is entirely possible that this is a chance finding -- so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions."
ness said that women planning to become pregnant should continue to take folic acid supplements.
he claimed that the current recommended dosage and "the experimental dosage are considerably different."
according to the uk's health standards, women planning to become pregnant and those who are in their first trimester of pregnancies should have 0.4 mg of folic acid everyday, which is more than 10 times lower than the dosage taken by the women in the above study.
two candidates face ukrainian presidential rerun in completely different mood
the two rivals who will face off for the ukrainian presidential rerun on the 26th of this month are geared up for the match.
western-leaning opposition leader yushchenko is confident of winning while pro-russian current prime minister yanukovich declared that he is no longer running for the "shameful" ruling party.
meanwhile, russian president putin changed his attitude towards ukraine's entering into the european union and expressed his pleasure to see it happen.
when asked about the percentage of votes he expected to get in the rerun, yushchenko told the reporters who filled the venue of the press conference, "conservatively speaking, i should have about 60 percent of the votes."
on the other hand, the anxious-looking yanukovich, who ducked several of the reporters' questions, only said, "we will win as per god's will" at the end.
yanukovich, the original anointed successor of current president kuchma, has changed his course and cast himself as the candidate who is fighting against the opposition party and the ruling party.
he was close to mentioning names when he said, "i used to trust those cowards and traitors who worked in the government, but now i am very disappointed. this government is very shameful."
kuchma made a deal with the opposition party to transfer part of the presidential power to the parliament through a legislative amendment in order to end the opposition party's large-scale protest and political turmoil that has lasted for two weeks since the presidential runoff on november 21.
the supreme court also declared the original victory of yanukovich invalid because of the rigged election process and ordered a rerun to be held.
powell's visit to hague a final push for europe-us harmony before leaving office
u.s. secretary of state powell held a meeting with eu senior officials today for a last attempt at bringing cohesion between the united states and the eu before his leaving office.
powell's european visit aims at repairing the diplomatic relations harmed by the iraq war. the hague is the last stop of his visit.
this might be powell's last official overseas visit. the eu promised him that they will work towards easing strained ties ahead of u.s. president bush's european visit next february.
nonetheless, differences between the two sides still exist.
dutch foreign minister bot, whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency, said, "we have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground in the second term of president bush."
eu external relations commissioner ms. waldner stated that she believed europe and the united states had already made some progress in "putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind us." however, she also realized that now is the "key moment in the eu-us relationship."
bush will meet with eu and nato leaders in brussels on february 22, 2005.
powell stated that bush's visit aims at mending the fissures caused by the iraqi factors.
powell has visited sofia and brussels during this visit but has produced limited results in improving the relationships.
especially in brussels, powell criticized the six anti-war nato members of hurting the "credibility and cohesion of the alliance" by not participating in the training exercises in iraq.
nevertheless, powell insisted that his meeting has shown the commitment of the united states in reestablishing full diplomatic relationships.
elected romanian president basescu faces challenges in forming government
romanian opposition candidate basescu won the close presidential election today. however, the mayor of bucharest, who holds a center-right position, will probably face huge challenges in forming a new government because of the multi-partied and fragmented parliament.
final official results announced by the romanian central election committee today showed that the justice and truth alliance candidate basescu won 51.23 percent of the votes while his rival, prime minister nastase, had 48.77 percent.
nastase conceded defeat and congratulated basescu.
the outgoing president iliescu had also congratulated basescu.
nastase indicated that his social democratic party will assist basescu in gaining romania's entry into the european union.
the social democratic party won the parliamentary election held on the 28th of last month.
basescu announced in a press conference, "today my priority is to form, as soon as possible, a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for romania to join the european union." romania will have to continue to live up to the requirements of gaining entry into the european union.
he stressed that romanians should understand the price they will have to pay for this integration. the nation should unite to ensure that there will be no questioning voices about this integration.
romania has completed the negotiations on joining the european union and is expected to become a member in january 2007.
basescu also listed fighting poverty, eliminating corruption, and ensuring judicial independence as priorities of his governing policies.
tumult over past work unsettled: oliver stone seeks peace with turkey
movie director oliver stone is trying to use the opportunity of promoting his new movie "alexander" in istanbul to make peace with turkey.
his screenplay for the classic "midnight express" has been criticized as tarnishing the image of turkey.
he told afp in an interview here, "i never intended the screenplay to be against turkey. it was against injustice everywhere."
turks have condemned stone since the first screening of this award-winning movie in 1978.
this movie was adapted from the memoirs of billy hayes.
hayes, an american youth who was caught at the istanbul airport for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country, was sentenced to 30 years in a turkish prison following a protracted legal battle.
turkish critics accused stone of taking liberties with rewriting hayes' original work into a racist screenplay. all the turkish characters in the movie are depicted as villains without exception.
the movie is also full of horrific prison scenes of rape and torture.
stone admitted, "perhaps some of the zealousness, some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much, too hard."
however, he added, "it was true that billy hayes did get sodomized in the turkish prison. he was convicted to a 30-year prison term for an offense not worth mentioning, and he was also treated brutally in prison. so this is all based on the facts."
stone said, "the bigger picture is that turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not properly working. america has similar problems."
japanese economic growth may slow down next year
the japanese economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a widening gap between the rich and the poor may destroy the harmonic atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of the year.
with huge corporate profits and strong consumer spending, japan has regained its confidence after 10 years of stagnation, but analysts rest their hopes for sustaining the economic growth on china despite the rising political tensions between the two countries.
evidence has gradually shown that the japanese economy may suffer a temporary setback in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to fall while manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid overstock.
according to the newly adopted statistical methodology, the japanese economy actually contracted slightly in the april-june quarter while it grew by just 0.1 percent in the july-september quarter, narrowly escaping a technical recession.
at present, economists are still greatly divided over the robustness of the japanese economy.
bnp paribas researchers anticipated a 2.3 percent growth in real terms in the current fiscal year that ends in march of next year and the next fiscal year.
they called 2005 the "year of recovery" based on the reasons that the us economy has remained stable on the recovery track and japanese consumer spending is picking up the slack for slower exports.
a more pessimistic note is that ufj institute economists predicted a mere 1.8 percent economic growth in this fiscal year and a lower 0.6 percent in the following year.
they pointed out the "lurking risk," meaning corporate profits have not led to higher personal gains.
french foreign minister: middle east peace progress to test france-us relations
after meeting with us secretary of state powell, french foreign minister barnier stated that the resumption of the middle east peace talks will be a "test" for their trans-atlantic ties.
france had called for a quick convening of an international meeting to move forward the israel-palestine peace process after the death of palestinian leader arafat but there was no sign that an agreement had been reached after the meeting of barnier and powell.
barnier flew from paris to washington for a lightning round of talks with powell and his designated successor rice, the national security advisor, then headed toward brussels for a european union summit.
both paris and washington agreed to repair the strained relations brought about by the us invasion of iraq last year but differences are still obvious in resolving the middle east impasse.
after a short meeting with powell at the state department, barnier stated, "we want to improve the future relations between the french and americans and europeans and americans."
he said, "i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between palestinians and israelis."
earlier this week, barnier called for the convening of an early international middle east conference in order to take advantage of what he called the "window of opportunity" presented after arafat's death last month.
however, powell remained non-committal.
he said that the two discussed the british plan of a meeting with palestinian participants but had not mentioned whether a broader international meeting would be convened.
us officials have made known that their most important task is to promote peace in israel and palestine, and to ensure the success of the palestinian election held next month.
this election will produce a leader who can control the islamic militants and resume the israel-palestine talks.
foreign minister machimura proposes fta talks with south korea in january
japanese foreign minister machimura nobutaka proposed today to hold talks on signing a free trade agreement (fta) between japan and south korea as early as next january.
jiji press reported that during his meeting with south korean foreign minister ban ki-moon in the southern city of ibusuki of kagoshima prefecture, machimura indicated that since tokyo and seoul both hoped to sign a fta agreement by the end of 2005, the two parties should resume talks as soon as possible.
before machimura's talks with ban ki-moon, japanese prime minister koizumi junichiro and south korean president roh moo-hyun held a summit on the 17th in which roh moo-hyun urged tokyo authorities to be cautious in imposing economic sanctions on north korea.
north korea had kidnapped several japanese nationals during the cold war and prime minister koizumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish north korea.
the families of the kidnapped victims were furious after japanese researchers concluded that the remains that pyongyang provided to prove the death of two hostages did not belong to the victims.
apart from the kidnapping issue, koizumi and roh moo-hyun both agreed that the six-nation talks that aim at checking north korean nuclear weapons expansion should recommence as soon as possible.
since the standoff sparked by north korea's secret nuclear weapons program in october 2002, no concrete results have been achieved in the first three rounds of the six-nation talks.
north korea later boycotted the fourth round of the six-nation talks scheduled to be held this september.
the six nations that take part in the talks are south korea, north korea, the united states, china, japan, and russia, respectively.
thai premier thaksin still expects to win february election
thai premier thaksin is confident of winning his second four-year term when entering 2005. however, his reputation was tarnished for not being able to suppress the bloody uprising of the separatist insurgents.
a thai national election is scheduled to be held on february 6, 2005. thaksin and his political rivals are actively preparing for the election. most analysts expected him to win despite the serious violent clashes and the bird flu in the south.
twelve people in thailand have died from bird flu this year. bird flu swept through most of the asian regions but was particularly serious in thailand. the thai government once admitted that it had "erred" in handling the epidemic.
however, this health problem is unlikely to depose thaksin's reelection. on the other hand, many people only asked how big a landslide his victory will be and what significance his victory will have on the muslim insurgency in the southern provinces.
kraisak, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, told afp, "the phenomenon is that no matter how one looks at thaksin, he has managed to capture a vast support from the public for the time being."
he said, "but things will start to disintegrate next year, if you look at the accumulation of wealth (by his family and associates), the social injustices and the violence."
social injustices and violence are the causes of riots in the deep south of thailand where islam is the majority, and sporadic revolts have been happening since january.
since january, muslim extremists have targeted buddhists, government officials, and security troops in their shootouts. they also carried out bombings and beheadings. up until now, more than 560 people have died and 100 have been reported missing.
palestinian cabinet secretary claims arafat poisoned a year ago
abdel rahman, cabinet secretary of late palestinian leader arafat, revealed that arafat was poisoned when receiving a delegation of supporters at the ramallah compound a year ago.
abdel rahman told the al-hayat newspaper, "something strange happened to arafat around a year ago. it was on september 25, 2003.
the president shook hands with each of the 30-some supporters. afterwards, the president began vomiting.
it was from that moment that the president's health started slowly deteriorating."
arafat passed away in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11.
some senior palestinian officials believed that arafat was poisoned.
nonetheless, french doctors stated that such allegations did not have any medical grounds.
two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by abdel rahman, the cabinet of israeli prime minister sharon decided to unseat arafat but did not specify by what means.
israel's threat had set off waves of support for arafat, who thus received several delegations of supporters.
abdel rahman recalled, "arafat shook hands with people who had come to express their support for arafat in his confinement imposed by israel."
on september 25 of last year, arafat received two groups; one was a global peace-advocating cyclist group while the other was a political activist group.
abdel rahman indicated, "the last time he became ill, on october 12, 2004, he had the same symptoms: vomiting, loss of appetite, and all the symptoms that were similar to contracting a flu."
bush admits iraqi troops need more training - defends rumsfeld
us president bush conceded today that iraqi troops are not ready to take over for us troops. he also warned that the election scheduled on january 30, 2005 will not be the end of the major insurgency in iraq.
in a one-hour press conference, bush also expressed his support for secretary of defense rumsfeld, insisting the pentagon chief "is doing a really fine job."
bush said that despite occasional major disagreements, he vowed to continue his cooperation with russian president putin, claiming that this is the moment to work towards ending the clashes in the middle east.
he believed the best way to handle issues regarding the surviving members of the "axis of evil" - iran and north korea, is through multilateral diplomacy.
car bombs exploded one after another in the two shiite holy cities of najaf and kabala yesterday, killing 66 people and injuring over 200. bush openly admitted that the iraqis have paid the price of the riots but insisted that it will not derail the january election.
bush cautioned americans that the iraqi election "is only the beginning of a political process" and warned, "i certainly don't expect the process to be trouble-free."
bush also admitted that the results of the iraqi security troops training are mixed.
he said, "there have been some cases where, when the heat got on, they left the battlefield."
he said that this kind of iraqi troops will never secure their country. that it is unacceptable.
nonetheless, he believed that the prolonged training of the iraqi troops by the us army would yield results.
white house: iraqi insurgents' attempts to derail election doomed to fail
twenty-two u.s. and iraqi soldiers were killed and over 60 were injured in an insurgent attack targeted at a restaurant on a u.s. military base in the major city of mosul in northern iraq at noon today. white house spokesperson mcclellan said that with the iraqi election approaching, terrorist attacks carried out by iraqi insurgents will intensify. nonetheless, these "enemies of freedom" will be eliminated.
reports from iraq stated that the huge explosion that caused serious casualties happened at noon in the u.s. military base restaurant while the soldiers were having lunch.
the iraqi interim government is expected to hold its first election following the downfall of hussein's regime, on january 30.
the united states has deployed 20,000 more troops to ensure safety during the iraqi election.
the number of u.s. soldiers stationed in iraq will reach 150,000 during the iraqi election.
mcclellan said that, as the election draws closer, saddam's loyalists, who want to go back to the past, will launch more terrorist attacks in order to derail the transitional government, but that "they will be defeated. they are being defeated."
a recent poll showed that 56 percent of americans believed that the iraq war is "not worth fighting." fifty-seven percent disagreed with president bush's handling of the iraqi situation, while 52 percent thought that secretary of defense rumsfeld should resign. mcclellan stated that president bush would not dance around the opinion poll.
"the opinion poll is a one-time figure while we continue our work according to progress in iraq."
mourners join funeral procession of philippine's political figure, poe
tens of thousands of fans attended the funeral today of philippine's top movie star, poe, which was held under tight security out of fear of riots.
the 65-year-old poe once ran for the presidency but was defeated.
poe's coffin, accompanied by a group of mourners, was pulled through the streets of manila in a carriage drawn by two white horses.
a large number of riot police were stationed around malacanang palace to prevent poe's supporters from rioting.
these people accused president arroyo of cheating in the presidential election on may 10.
the army was also on heightened alert amid intelligence reports of a possible coup to overthrow arroyo and replace her with poe's widow, rocess.
the funeral, however, ended peacefully. fans chanted poe's initials - fpj - and waved the posters he once used for his election.
poe died of a stroke on december 14.
crying women and children showered the coffin with flowers when the hearse wound its way to the cemetery.
since justice secretary gonzales warned that some people might use the funeral to stir up trouble, malacanang palace, which was close to the route of the procession, was barricaded with huge shipping containers.
gonzales said that "a credible intelligence report" showed that some people had conspired to use the funeral march and burial to instigate the masses to go against the government.
however, armed forces spokesman lieutenant colonel pascual claimed that the coup conspiracy was obviously dissolved after troops were deployed to guard key areas.
arroyo later stepped out of malacanang palace to greet the military police that guarded the area.
armitage warns syria to cooperate with u.s. on iraqi, lebanese issues
u.s. deputy secretary of state armitage issued warnings to syria today that future relations between damascus and washington will depend on syria's willingness to cooperate with the united states on issues with iraq and lebanon.
armitage exerted more pressure on syria during an interview with arab reporters.
the state department released the interview content earlier.
when asked whether tensions between the united states and syria are expected to continue, armitage replied, "i hope that our relations with syria do not worsen further but it's entirely in the hands of (syrian president) assad."
the state department's no. 2 figure stated that damascus should carry out resolution 1559 passed by the un security council this september and end all interference in the neighboring country of lebanon.
armitage claimed that through its behavior, syria "is not working against the united states, but to set itself against the entire international community."
when reporters further asked if the united states would bring up syria's refusal to cooperate next january when the un security council discusses renewing the mandate of the united nations interim force in lebanon, armitage's reply was "it is very possible."
when touching on iraqi issues, armitage conceded that damascus has adopted some measures that meet u.s. demands, such as strengthening its joint border patrols with iraq and blocking the sources of insurgent funds.
nonetheless, he also pointed out that syria has "to do much more."
ait, terco sign lease on new building site in neihu
the american institute in taiwan (ait) and the taipei economic and cultural representative office in the u.s. (tecro) signed a lease on a new ait building site in neihu.  ait director douglas paal stated that the new building is currently being designed. he hoped that construction would be finished as soon as possible so that they could operate in a safe and modern environment.

witnesses at the signing ceremony included ait deputy director keegan and terco deputy director general jacqueline liu. foreign minister mark chen was also present.
ait was established according to the taiwan relations act to handle unofficial relations between the united states and taiwan. it has offices in both taipei and kaohsiung.
douglas paal mentioned in his speech that ait has been working with terco and taipei city government to find a piece of land to construct a new ait building for more than 10 years.
he said that the existing hsin yi road office looks old and shabby and is literally running out of space.
for ait, moving to a new office building will be a challenge. ait can centralize its offices, which are scattered throughout taipei, and operate in a safe and modern environment.
he stated that the new building is currently being designed. he hoped that the building will add luster to taiwan and will be something that taipei residences will take pride in.
once the design is completed, they will invite bids for the construction contract. the construction will begin as soon as the contract is awarded. it is hoped that the groundbreaking will take place in a few years.
ait spokesperson dana smith said that the office building, including rent and design, is expected to cost approximately us $160 million. many factors will determine whether it can be finished by 2008, but she hoped that it would be as soon as possible.
thousands of pilgrims flock to bethlehem for midnight mass
thousands of pilgrims are gathering in bethlehem in the west bank waiting to attend midnight mass.
meanwhile, the mainstream palestinian liberation organization, fatah, is likely to win over hamas in yesterday's palestinian regional elections.
as for violent clashes, gunfire broke out between israeli troops and palestinian gunmen, resulting in the deaths of three palestinian youths.
israeli settlers blocked a major road in protest of mortar attacks on the settlement regions.
palestinian liberation organization chairman abbas was also permitted to go to the west bank town of bethlehem; this is the first time israeli authorities have allowed top-ranking palestinian leaders to attend christmas celebrations in four years.
the late palestinian leader arafat had been a regular guest at the midnight mass in bethlehem after returning to the palestinian region in 1994. however, since the beginning of december 2001, arafat had been confined to his ramallah headquarters by israeli troops.
the latin patriarch of bethlehem, sabbah, set off from jerusalem shortly after noon to begin his traditional procession to manger square in bethlehem, where thousands of christians and muslim onlookers were gathering.
sabbah is scheduled to speak to thousands of pilgrims during midnight mass at the church of the nativity.
pilgrims holding santa balloons packed manger square before noon and kept going in and out of the church of the nativity. a christmas tree outside the church was decorated with all kinds of lights and ornaments.
israeli authorities had eased travel restrictions to make it easier for christians from the gaza strip, the west bank, and israel to attend the midnight mass in bethlehem on christmas eve.
putin declares purchase of yuko's major asset is to protect state interests
russian president putin stated today that the state's purchase of russian oil giant yuko's major asset was to protect the interests of the state. it is also the first re-nationalization action taken in the post-soviet era.
when discussing the state-run petroleum company rosneft's purchase of yuko's subsidiary company, yuganskneftegaz, at the end-of-the-year press conference in the kremlin, putin stated, "today the state, using absolutely legal market mechanisms, is protecting its interests.
i consider this absolutely normal."
rosneft became the new owner of yuganskneftegaz after acquiring baikal finance group, the company that won the bid for yuganskneftegaz at an earlier secret auction.
rosneft issued an unexpected announcement a little before midnight last night - that it has acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown baikal finance group.
this acquisition gives the kremlin solid control over the energy industry, which is vital to russia.
in the past 18 months, russia has repeatedly attacked yuko and its billionaire founder, khodorkorsky, who is presently in prison.
rosneft is merging with state-run gazprom. with the addition of yuganskneftegaz, the three together will control one fifth of the total oil production in russia and all its natural gas production, thus becoming the world's largest energy group.
putin defends the state-purchase actions by criticizing murky privatizations in the 1990s.
the privatization policy at that time had allowed russia's most valuable economic asset to fall into the hands of slick businessmen like khodorkorsky.
baikal finance group won control of yuganskneftegaz earlier with a bid of u.s. $9.35 billion.
yushchenko declares victory in ukraine presidential election
with the preliminary election results showing opposition party leader yushchenko leading his rival, current prime minister yanukovich, in the rerun of the presidential election, and yushchenko's declaring victory himself, yushchenko's supporters again gathered at kiev's central independent square for a victory celebration.
50-year-old yushchenko told the crowd at the square, "this is a unique, clear political victory."
he said, "this is an elegant victory for the people, who have proven their power. ukrainians have bravely stood up and resisted probably the most perverse regime in eastern europe. this is a victory for the ukrainian nation, the ukrainian people."
he stated, "we have been independent for 14 years but we were not free."
yushchenko added, "today, ukraine entered a new political era.
the era of (outgoing president) kuchma, (kuchma's predecessor) kravchuk, and (current prime minister) yanukovich is a thing of the past."
according to the ukrainian central election committee, citing the counted votes at more than half of the polling precincts, opposition leader yushchenko is temporarily leading his rival, present prime minister yanukovich, by 16 percent in this historical presidential runoff election.
the ukrainian central election committee stated that pro-western yushchenko has 56.33 percent of the votes, compared to 39.86 percent for pro-russian yanukovich.
the results were based on the votes counted at 50.96 percent of the polling precincts across ukraine.
there were over 33,000 polling precincts in ukraine.
the exit poll released earlier also showed that yushchenko led yanukovich by 15 to 20 percent.
japanese ministry of internal affairs and communications pilots telecommuting to reduce stress of office life
the japanese ministry of internal affairs and communications launched an advanced internet program today, in the hopes that by 2010, 20 percent of the japanese workforce can "telecommute" from home through this program in order to reduce stress from office life and disruptive family problems.
an official from the ministry of internal affairs and communications stated that currently, approximately 4 million japanese, representing 6 percent of the total workforce of 63.2 million people, utilize technology to work outside the office.
starting in january, six ministry of internal affairs and communications employees will be working outside the office, either from home, from universities, or from libraries through high-speed internet service at least once a week.
the ministry of internal affairs and communications will then expand the scope of this advanced program based on feedback, until 20 percent of its 2500 employees can work from home by 2006.
the ministry of internal affairs and communications official said that this program, which allows employees to hold meetings through internet chat rooms and teleconferencing, will hopefully "improve the efficiency of work places."
he said that telecommuting would allow employees to spend more time with their families, so that breadwinners can also help out with more chores.
he stated that this program could also reduce traffic congestion, including car exhaust and the overcrowding of trains during rush hour.
he claimed that the goal of this program is, "through the encouragement of sharing telecommuting technologies with the private sector," to increase the ratio of japanese telecommuters to 10 percent by 2005 and then to 20 percent by 2010.
pentagon launches unprecedented relief efforts for asian tsunami victims
the pentagon stated today that it has launched one of its biggest relief efforts to help asian tsunami victims, including mobilizing two aircraft carrier battle groups, 20 aircraft, including reconnaissance and supply planes, and tens of thousands of personnel.
lt. cmdr hicks, a spokesman for the pentagon, said that after the december 26th tsunami that killed over 80,000 people, the u.s. military is facing the challenge of operating in several different regions at the same time.
he told afp, "it is one of the largest humanitarian relief operations by the pentagon."
lt. gen. conway, director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff responsible for military actions, stated that they were seeking to assess the scope of this disaster and had sent disaster relief assessment teams to thailand, sri lanka, and indonesia.
the pentagon said that it had dispatched 20 aircraft to south asia, among which were six c-130 transporters that carried drinking water and food, five kc-135 refueling planes, and nine p3 reconnaissance planes.
the pentagon also mobilized the "abraham lincoln" and "bonhomme richard" aircraft carriers and their corresponding ships.
conway stated that the "lincoln" strike group, with its corresponding 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel, were sent to the gulf of siam from hong kong and will eventually deploy off the coast of somalia.
the "richard," which carries 25 helicopters, 2,100 marines, and 1,400 sailors, had left guam and is expected to arrive at the bay of bengal by january 7.
the pentagon has decided to mobilize five ships from guam and two ships that can produce fresh water from the diego garcia base on the indian ocean.
conway stated that the u.s. army's relief operations would use the thailand utapao base on the gulf of siam as its command center.
argentine capital nightclub fire killed at least 169 and injured 375
city officials of the argentine capital of buenos aires said today that a huge fire broke out in a downtown nightclub in buenos aires, killing at least 169 people and injuring 375.
when the fire broke out, the nightclub was packed with approximately 2,000 youngsters who were celebrating the end of the school year.
stein, the city health secretary, said that the above casualty toll was not final.
argentine interior minister fernandez told reporters outside the still burning nightclub, "this is a disaster! this is a disaster!" and cautioned that the death toll was speculative.
stein said that at least 375 people were injured in the burning flames, including 18 police officers.
stein stated that a fire broke out in this downtown discotheque before midnight on the 30th. approximately 2,000 youngsters were attending a rock concert at that time.
buenos aires mayor ibarra claimed that unconfirmed reports stated that the fire started after someone tossed a flare during the concert.
ibarra told the todo noticias television channel today, "this is a terrible night."
while firefighters were battling the flames, the victims' bodies were lined up on the street.
a chaotic situation emerged outside the burned discotheque this morning, with hundreds of police and firefighters mingling with terrified youngsters and anxious parents who were frantically looking for their children.
un: relief supplies won't reach aceh victims for weeks
the united nations said today that the urgently needed aid will take "weeks" to deliver to tsunami victims in isolated regions of aceh, indonesia.
u.s. navy helicopters arrived at aceh's capital of banda aceh today. more and more field hospitals are operating inside the city while large amounts of relief supplies are gradually arriving at the airport.
however, elmquist, the chief of the un office for coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia, told reporters that the relief supplies cannot be delivered quickly due to numerous coordination and infrastructure problems.
elmquist told the reporter over the telephone after returning to jakarta from banda aceh, "it's going to take weeks before we can get the relief supplies to all the isolated areas."
he said, "it's a concern and we are desperately doing what we can to find ways of establishing distribution systems in banda aceh."
the united nations and other relief organizations have warned that if victims in indonesian sumatra regions do not have clean drinking water, food, and medical treatment immediately, they will die in a few days.
when asked if the delay in delivery was literally sentencing the tsunami victims to death, elmquist replied, "i hope not. i hope that people are finding ways to get food and water, but obviously it's not a situation we are happy about."
he said, "it's a very serious situation and we can only hope that it's possible to do something quicker."
japan outpledges nations with 500 million u.s. dollars
japan promised today to provide u.s. $500 million to aid countries affected by the indian ocean tsunami. while countries are competing to assist victims of the world's worst disaster, japan's pledge has topped the donor's list of all nations and increased the total international relief and reconstruction fund raised so far to u.s. $1.6 billion.
japanese prime minister koizumi junichiro issued a statement saying that as asia's largest economy, japan would consider providing more assistance, including money and technology.
he said, "japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways: financial resources, knowledge and technology, and human resources."
he stated, "for the time being, japan will extend to affected countries and international organizations concerned up to u.s. $500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the damage."
koizumi added that he would participate in the world leaders meeting held in jakarta on the 6th to discuss issues on assisting tsunami-hit countries.
after u.s. president bush was accused of being slow in reacting to this human catastrophe, the u.s. government had raised the relief amount it promised ten-fold to u.s. $350 million yesterday.
china, considered to be more and more inclined to challenge japan's influence in asia, also promised to provide u.s. $60.5 million assistance, a huge amount for a developing country.
koizumi claimed, "japan will make further contributions by utilizing fire department helicopters and personnel.
japan will also consider, as early as possible, additional contributions by mobilizing japan self-defense forces aircraft, vessels and personnel."
japan had originally pledged u.s. $30 million to aid tsunami-hit countries.
a spokesman for the foreign ministry said that the u.s. $30 million was included in the u.s. $500 million that koizumi mentioned.
who: 50 organizations will provide medical aid to aceh indonesia
the world health organization (who) said today that 50 relief organizations have arrived in aceh to provide medical aid to survivors of the tsunami.
petersen, the who's indonesian representative, said that the who was trying to coordinate all the organizations and had a meeting with them in the afternoon.
petersen claimed that the coordination was extremely difficult since many organizations have gone directly to aceh to provide relief efforts.
in a telephone interview from jakarta, petersen said, "we are trying to sort it out, everyone has just come in, however, everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate."
petersen stressed that the main concern of the who was to prevent the outbreak of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea, which can cause tens of thousands of deaths.
petersen said, "we are very worried since we have a large number of people displaced who don't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies.
so we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks."
nonetheless, petersen emphasized that there had not been any sign of such disease yet.
the indonesian health ministry said that the death toll of the tsunami in sumatra may reach 100,000 people, with most of them in aceh.
since most of aceh's medical facilities had been destroyed, since last week the indonesian army and the governments of singapore and australia have set up at least eight field hospitals, while the united nations children's fund has also begun distributing basic medical kits to help 200,000 children.
powell predicts shiites to win in iraqi election
u.s. secretary of state powell predicted today that the shiites will win in the upcoming iraqi election. however, he believed that since the iraqi and iranian shiites were on bad terms with each other before, it should not be a concern that the shiites' victory may increase iranian influence in iraq.
more and more evidence has shown that sunni muslims will either boycott the january 31 election or will be prevented from participating in the election by the iraqi authorities for spreading insurgency.
powell said on nbc's meet the press show, "the new government that comes into place in baghdad, the transitional national assembly, will be majority shiite.
that's the majority of the population."
shiite muslims made up more than 60 percent of the iraqi population; most of them reside in southern and central iraq.
the sunnis, who constitute 20 percent of the population, live in the central and western provinces.
former foreign minister pachachi, who is the current leader of the iraqi independent democrats dominated by the sunnis, called for the postponement of the election today but powell claimed that the iraqi election will be held as scheduled.
powell added that the control of the future iraqi government by the shiites does not mean that iran will have control of iraq's political situation.
he said, "my sense right now is that, even though there may be iranian influence - and iranians will try to influence the iraqi political situation, of course - there is a sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between iranian and iraqi shiites."
international aid pours in; tsunami victims racing against time
overseas rescue troops are airdropping food and building clean water supply systems in tsunami-hit disaster areas in asia in order to help several million homeless and starving victims.
figures showed that the death toll has reached almost 150,000.
relief supplies continue to pour in from governments while u.s. president bush appointed his father, bush senior, and former president clinton to be in charge of raising private aid.
the delegation headed by u.s. secretary of state powell arrived in thailand last night to show u.s. concern and assess the relief work progress before the crisis summit in the indonesian capital of jakarta on the 6th.
accompanying powell were jeb bush, younger brother of president bush and governor of florida; and natsios, the chief of the u.s. agency for international development.
powell will lead the delegation to tour thailand, indonesia, and sri lanka to inspect the disaster situation before attending the summit on the 6th.
powell stated that the objective of his tour was to assess the disaster situation "and see what else we might need to do" but he will not make any immediate promise to increase the donations beyond the u.s. $350 million already pledged.
after the disaster, talks of giving up the search for thousands of visitors who remain missing, most of them foreign tourists, have surfaced.
however, thai prime minister thaksin vowed to continue the search in this country.
thaksin told reporters at phuket island, "foreign experts have told me that they (the missing) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests. we will continue to use our best efforts, and we will not stop searching."
the largest international rescue effort in history continues.
the navy helicopters dispatched from the uss "abraham lincoln" were carrying out their second day of duties to airdrop relief materials and transport survivors in aceh indonesia.
rear admiral crowder, commander of the lincoln, said 50,000 pounds of food and water had been delivered to the disaster areas, and the mission was "going great."
political tug-of-war behind tsunami relief efforts
while asia's tsunami relief supplies pour into the disaster areas, a less honorable activity is secretly underway as governments fight over who should give and who should receive, and who should lead the largest relief operation in modern times.
the disaster that caused almost 150,000 deaths has revived old battles, including the disagreements between the united states, the united nations, and europe, and the struggle for leadership in asia.
however, relief experts still hold cautious hope that the global nature of this disaster that hit so many countries may set a precedent: governments honor their promises to help.
juma, professor of international development at harvard's john f. kennedy school of government said, "there has never been an aid pledge for which governments have come through 100 percent and on time."
donations pledged by governments have reached u.s. $2 billion. important international figures including un secretary general annan and u.s. secretary of state powell, as well as leaders of australia, china, and japan, will hold a crisis summit with rich political overtones in jakarta on the 6th.
after allegations of a slow response and the open criticism by top un relief official egeland of rich countries for being 'stingy,' u.s. president bush has increased u.s. aid almost ten-fold to u.s. $350 million.
in asia, the tsunami disaster has led to a covert race for regional influence. the increasingly confident china has pledged u.s. $60.5 million, a huge sum for a developing nation.
japan, which has cut its foreign aid budget in six consecutive years, has also shattered talk of its declining national power by promising to provide at least u.s. $500 million, an amount that dwarfs all the other nations.
world leaders to tour sri lankan disaster areas
sri lankan officials stated that world leaders including un secretary general annan and u.s. secretary of state powell have arrived in sri lanka successively to personally examine the tsunami disaster situation that claimed 30,600 lives in the country at the end of last month.
they said that powell had arrived, while south korean prime minister lee hae-chan was scheduled to arrive later that afternoon.
a press release issued by the u.s. embassy said that powell will visit some of the hardest-hit areas by the tsunami disaster of december 26, including the southern region of galle, where u.s. marines are stationed for relief operations.
the south korean embassy said that lee hae-chan will be accompanied by the sri lankan premier to tour the western coastlines.
the declaration said, "together with sri lanka's premier rajapakse, the korean prime minister will travel along the western coast to have a first-hand view of the destruction of lives, livelihoods and property caused by the tsunami."
lee hae-chan will stop over at hambantota, the hardest-hit area, to supervise the relief operations by korean civilian and non-governmental organizations.
un secretary general annan is set to arrive at night for a two-day visit.
samarsinghe, spokesman for the united nations, said, "he will be touring along with world bank president wolfensohn to some of the affected regions in the south and the east."
lee jong-wook, the world health organization director-general, is also set to arrive in colombo today.
german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to arrive in sri lanka by the weekend.
sri lankan officials said that more world leaders are set to arrive in the next few weeks.
among those leaders is canadian prime minister martin. canada announced yesterday that marin will visit sri lanka and thailand later this month.
bush: u.s. will enhance peace efforts after palestinian election
u.s. president bush said today that he was "heartened" by the strong turnout of today's palestinian election and promised that the u.s. would enhance peace efforts.
president bush said in a statement, "palestinians throughout the west bank and gaza took a key step toward building a democratic future by choosing a new president of the autonomous government in the election.
observers of the election described it as a largely free and fair election."
he said, "this is a historic day for the palestinian people and for the people of the middle east."
exit polls showed that former prime minister abbas won the election with a landslide two thirds of the votes.
he will succeed arafat to become the chairman of the palestinian autonomous government.
bush stated, "these efforts - including today's presidential elections and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months - are essential for the establishment of a sovereign, independent, viable, democratic, and peaceful palestinian state. this new state will ensure the safety of israel."
he said that the u.s. government looks forward to working with the newly elected chairman of the palestinian autonomous government and the palestinians in the advancement of the cause of middle east peace.
middle east peace meets the desire of the israelis and palestinians to coexist in peace and security.
bush also called on israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situations in the west bank and the gaza strip.
he added, arab states must "take concrete steps with all related parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace, lend financial support to the palestinian people, and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists."
annan's plan to visit sri lankan rebel-held regions obstructed
un secretary general annan said today that he hoped to return to sri lanka one day and "see all parts of the country."
annan just finished his two-day visit to tsunami-ravaged areas in sri lanka, but reports said that the sri lankan government once stopped him from visiting rebel-held northern areas.
when asked whether he was banned from visiting the rebel-held areas of the "liberation tigers of tamil eelam" as widely reported by many national newspapers, annan said, "i'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process."
annan said that president kumaratunga was personally against his on-site visit to the guerrilla-controlled areas for fear that the rebels would use his visit as political capital.
he stated, "i raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the efforts.
i was also able to discuss that with president kumaratunga."
annan's failure to visit the northern rebel-held area of jaffina had angered the residents. several hundred people protested in front of the un office in jaffina.
however, the sri lankan government strongly denied the media report, saying that the media are "misleading" the issue.
on the other hand, while relief efforts are in full swing, the sri lankan meteorological department warned that its coastline may be hit by a cyclone that is currently building off its coast.
russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes illnesses in children
the weekly-published british science journal nature reported that the highly toxic rocket fuel shot out during russia's launch of space shuttles at kazakhstan's baikonur space base is causing serous illnesses in nearby children, but russian space agency rosaviakosmos denied the allegation today.
the issue of nature published today quoted research as saying that the levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents of the polluted areas are twice as high as that in general areas.
this research was conducted by a group of russian scientists headed by epidemiologist zykov.
rosaviakosmos responded, "no direct influence of space-related activities on the population's health has so far been established."
this research, cited in nature, focused on children in the altai republic.
the altai republic is located in the mountainous region on the southern border of siberia.
the altai republic was chosen as the research subject because of the pollution from unburnt fuel, especially hydrazine.
part of russian's space launch missions used hydrazine as fuel in the early stages.
zykov compared the health records of approximately 1,000 children in the two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with 3,300 health records of children from nearby unpolluted areas in the control group.
nature reported that zykov concluded that children from the worst-polluted areas who require medical treatment are twice as many as the unpolluted control group and their treatment time is twice as long.
white house says iraqi election won't be flawless
the white house admitted today that the iraqi election scheduled for january 30 is "not going to be perfect." meanwhile, two car bomb attacks happened in mosul, iraq, killing at least two iraqi soldiers.
when asked whether he agreed with iraqi prime minister allawi, that violence would prevent some iraqi areas from voting, white house spokesman mcclellan said, "we all recognize that the election is not going to be perfect."
he said, "this is the first time iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders. it's for a transitional government, and it's one of three elections that will take place over the course of this year."
mcclellan stated, "and so we're going to do everything we can to help the iraqi people and the interim government ensure as broad a participation as possible in this upcoming election."
violent clashes broke out in iraq on the 11th, killing at least 25 people, six of whom died in a car bomb attack that happened in ex-president hussein's hometown of tikrit. under such conditions, allawi acknowledged that some iraqi areas would not be able to take part in this month's election.
meanwhile, two car bomb attacks happened in mosul, iraq, today, killing at least two iraqi soldiers.
u.s. army sergeant schaeffer told the afp that a truck exploded before it tried to attack a joint convoy of u.s. and iraqi military vehicles, killing an unknown number of civilians.
schaeffer said that another vehicle parked across the street exploded and killed two iraqi soldiers.
u.s. november trade deficit hits record high of $60 billion
figures announced by the u.s. department of commerce showed that u.s. exports shrunk 2.3 percent last november, sending the trade deficit to a record high of u.s. $60.3 billion.
u.s. exports fell to a five-month low of u.s. $95.6 billion. meanwhile, as u.s. imported oil rose to u.s. $14.2 billion, an increase of over u.s. $2 billion or 1.3 percent, imports thus increased by 1.3 percent, reaching an all-time high of u.s. $155.8 billion.
the trade deficit increased by 7.7 percent from last october's revised u.s. $56 billion and a huge 50.8 percent increase from u.s. $40 billion in november the year before.
according to a survey conducted by cbs marketwatch, wall street economists expected the trade deficit on goods and services would drop to around u.s. $53.3 billion.
despite a weak u.s. dollar that makes goods produced in the u.s. cheaper at home and abroad, the u.s. trade deficit continues to expand.
the report released by the commerce department today will add pressure on the dollar and revive appeals for washington to take action in u.s. energy independence and the resolution of the u.s.-china trade imbalance.
a drop in u.s. exports last november was caused by a reduction of u.s. $1.4 billion in capital goods, including u.s. $325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines.
industrial materials exports, mostly energy, fell by u.s. $800 million.
automobile, consumer goods, and food exports also fell.
japanese defense agency director-general: remembers militarist past, respects neighboring countries' dignity
japanese defense agency director-general ono yoshinori stated today that while japan adopts a higher international profile, it will not forget its militarist past and will remember the "dignity" of neighboring asian countries.
when asked about the uneasiness caused by japan's deployment of the self-defense forces to south asian tsunami disaster areas, ono said, "while we get along with southeast asian nations, we should never forget the past."
he told reporters, "we must build relations with friendly countries so that we can tell them that we have good intentions.
we should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while looking at the past as it was."
ono specifically mentioned that this year marked the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. he said, "we want to be reborn and cooperate for the sake of a new era."
ono just finished his visit to several south asian tsunami-ravaged countries. he said that he felt the "dignity" of an independent nation when the indonesian leader told him that the japanese self-defense forces should finish their rescue mission no later than the end of march.
the united nations has voiced its concern over the deadline imposed by the indonesian government on foreign troops.
foreign troops received broad credit for rescuing tsunami survivors in remote areas.
close to 1,000 japanese self-defense personnel are heading toward countries hit by the tsunami of december 26. over 163,000 people died in this natural disaster.
this is the biggest deployment of the japanese self-defense forces since the end of the second world war.
the post-war constitution in japan dominated by the united states prohibits the use of force by the self-defense forces.
political intervention in nhk program.  japanese media touch off debates
according to rumors, nhk toned down a program about women who were forced by the japanese army to become prostitutes during the second world war that aired a few years ago, due to pressure from political figures. japanese liberal media thus launched a dispute with their conservative colleagues on the issue.
according to sources, nhk cut the majority of the interview contents in the program after discussing it with top politicians. most of the interviewees were critics of japanese wartime behavior and victims who were forced to become prostitutes. nhk's action had solicited criticism from the liberal media.
nonetheless, conservative newspapers defended nhk's decision to revise the contents of the program, stating that the company's senior officials had the responsibility to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the program's contents.
the dispute, which focused on a program aired in 2001 about a mock trial of the crime committed by the japanese army of forcing women to become prostitutes during the war, erupted last week.
the trial was held by a japanese women's rights group in december 2000. the verdict found late emperor hirohito guilty of allowing the japanese army to commandeer prostitutes during the japanese occupation of asian countries.
historians said that at least 200,000 young women were forced to become prostitutes at frontline japanese brothels during the war. most of them came from korea, but there were also women from taiwan, china, the philippines, and indonesia.
the program's producer, nagai satoru, blew the whistle in a tearful press conference on the 13th, saying that before the program was aired, nhk top officials had met with senators abe and nakagawa of the ruling liberal democratic party, who showed concern over the program contents.
according to nagai, nhk top officials then re-edited the program and watered down its contents.
he said, "nhk bowed to political pressures."
abe and nakagawa admitted that they had met with nhk personnel and told them that they had to be "fair", but strongly denied that they had exerted pressure on the company.
eurozone indicators show core inflation under control
economists said today that eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation remains under control.
meanwhile, both eurozone industrial output and french consumer spending are expected to fall.
it is expected that the european union's statistics service will confirm the inflation rate is up a little from 2.2 percent in november to 2.3 percent in december when it releases inflation figures on the 20th.
but the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases, while the core inflation rate is expected to remain at 1.9 percent.
core inflation figures and consumer price index figures will be released together.
economists pointed out that core inflation, which excludes food, energy, tobacco, and alcohol prices, has remained at 1.6 to 2.0 percent for the past two years.
european central bank president trichet stated on the 13th that short-term price pressures have dropped recently.
although inflation will remain above 2 percent in the next few months, a decrease is expected by the end of the year.
meanwhile, another economist stated that a decrease in eurozone november industrial output to be released on the 18th is expected due to a slowdown in growth in germany.
german industrial output dropped 1.7 percent in november while economists surveyed by afp's financial news subsidiary expected that eurozone output would decrease by 0.4 percent in november after a drop of 0.5 percent in october.
schmieding of the bank of america said that eurozone output may rebound in december.
bureaucracy blows second strike to tsunami victims
three weeks after the assault of the worst tsunami in history, survivors are fighting pernicious habits of red tape and politicking. meanwhile, the world focus has shifted elsewhere.
thousands of decomposed bodies are continuously being unearthed from the rubble, bringing the death toll of the december 26 tsunami to over 168,000 people. at the same time, the approaching iraqi election and president bush's inauguration have replaced the tsunami as the headlines of the global media.
indonesia originally ordered foreign troops who engaged in humanitarian missions to withdraw within three months but later rescinded this demand.
in thailand, the leaders of canada, sweden, norway, and finland are meeting to discuss the reconstruction and body-identification work.
nonetheless, the survivors are facing new challenges such as the delay in the distribution of relief materials that poured in from around the world, caused by the deep-rooted bureaucracy in indonesia.
busriadi, a fisherman from a small village near banda aceh, the capital of aceh on sumatra island in indonesia, said, "we are like people who do not exist. we have been hit hard by the disaster, lost everything, and are famished."
he stated, "where is the food, the clothes, and other relief we see on television flowing into aceh?"
like thousands of other victims, busriadi lost his identification card and other official documents, thus turning his efforts in getting aid into a nightmare.
despite his pleading with officials and bustling about everyday going through the formalities, the result is the same: no aid.
zeng qinghong believed to have visited zhao ziyang at his death bed
the hong kong-based information center for human rights in china stated that zeng qinghong, vice president of the people's republic of china, visited the deposed former party secretary general of the chinese communist party, zhao ziyang, at the hospital before he passed away this morning.
the information center said that according to zhao's family, zen qinghong visited zhao at a beijing hospital at 6 a.m. today. zhao passed away about an hour later, at the age of 85.
zhao ziyang was once the party secretary general of the chinese communist party and the prime minister. he was ousted in 1989 for his opposition to the suppression by force of the democratic movement in tiananmen square. he was later held under house arrest and was considered an unwelcome figure by the government.
the information center said that according to zhao's family, the current premier, wen jiabao, who was once under zhao, did not visit him when he was terminally ill.
nonetheless, before zhao ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th, tian jiyun, a retired central committee member who was once zhao's assistance, went to visit him.
the information center for human rights in china has kept contact with zhao's family and has been releasing timely and accurate information on zhao ziyang's situation for years.
the information center indicated that approximately 20 retired key members of the party, the government, and the army planned to issue an open letter to the chinese communist party calling for the reevaluation of zhao ziyang's contributions and asking to hold a public memorial service for him.
the center added that zhao's family would not be allowed to hold or make arrangements for the funeral; all final decisions on related arrangements will be made by the party.
liang baiqi, zhao ziyang's wife, is 86 years old.
the information center said that she had not been told of her husband's death until this evening due to the poor condition of her health.
democratization urged in china after zhao ziyang's death
after former chinese communist party leader zhao ziyang died of an illness today, people around the world spoke highly of him while japanese prime minister koizumi junichiro, the taiwan government, and overseas chinese democratic figures all called on beijing to implement zhao ziyang's democratic reform ideas.
zhao ziyang was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the tiananmen square democratic movement and had spent the rest of his life under house arrest. he passed away in a beijing hospital this morning at the age of 85.
according to jiji news services, japanese prime minister koizumi said, "i want them (china) to make efforts at democratization" while mourning zhao ziyang's death.
taiwan also urged china to implement democratic and political reforms after the death of zhao ziyang.
overseas chinese democratic figures praised zhao ziyang as "one of china's greatest reformers" who sacrificed his own political career to oppose the bloody crackdown on the democratic movement in tiananmen square.
lian shengde, a former student movement leader and the president of the new york-based free china movement, said, "during his 15 years under house arrest, he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward the rule of law and democracy.
zhao ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle."
some democratic figures asked the chinese government to hold a public funeral for zhao ziyang and to provide fair assessments of his achievements.
however, they admitted that zhao ziyang would not receive such courteous treatment, since the chinese government fears that people who are dissatisfied with communist rule will use this opportunity to stir up riots.
the 1989 student movement was provoked by the death of reformist leader hu yaobang.
xinhua news agency published a brief report today saying that comrade zhao ziyang died of an illness in a beijing hospital. this was the only official statement on the matter.
un: rich countries fail to honor poverty reduction promise
a panel of un-appointed experts said in a new report that rich countries have fallen short in their promises to provide financial assistance in order to reduce by half the population of the world living in extreme poverty by 2015.
rich nations worldwide have committed themselves to the un's ambitious "millennium development goals" project to improve the fate of the poor and suffering in the world.
however, with more than 1 billion people worldwide living on less than u.s. $1 a day and 2.7 billion surviving on less than u.s. $2 per day, un experts noted that time is running out for the rich nations to honor their word.
brown, head of the un development program, said, "with the proper mobilization of resources and political will, and reform in developing countries as well as in developed countries, these goals are still achievable."
un experts stated that 22 rich nations in the world have promised to provide 0.7 percent of their gross national product to assist developing countries, but that at present, they are only offering 0.25 percent.
un secretary general annan commissioned development experts headed by former harvard economist sachs to prepare the report on the progress of the goals, which include eliminating extreme poverty, making primary education universal, lowering the child mortality rate, and fighting hiv/aids and other fatal diseases.
the report said, "practical solutions exist. the political framework has been established. and for the first time, the cost is utterly affordable. all that is needed is action."
un announces implementation of global disaster alert system
the united nations announced that a global disaster alert system will be set up to prevent major natural disasters.
however, following the south asian tsunami disaster, there are still debates on which country's technology should be used in this disaster system.
at the end of a global meeting held in kobe, japan, by several un agencies, a joint statement was issued stating that un experts will set up a global disaster alert system to reduce the damages caused by major natural disasters.
the huge catastrophe caused by the south asian tsunami had enraged countries around the indian ocean.
briceno, director of the international strategy for disaster reduction, said, "the new program will bring peace and safety to mankind.
an effective early warning system will protect the life and safety of millions of people worldwide."
however, the un statement was mostly symbolic.
unesco officials stated that more important talks are still required for this disaster alert system.
unesco is heading the establishment of a global disaster alert system.
bernal, head of unesco's intergovernmental oceanographic commission, said, "right now we have several proposals that are completely uncoordinated by different countries. what we need to do is to coordinate them."
bernal said that the commission will hold two meetings in 60 days, hoping that a decision on which tsunami alert system to use can be reached in these two meetings.
one of the meetings will take place in paris while the other is yet to be determined.
bernal hopes that the decision can be finalized in july and that the global disaster alert system can be ready in mid-2006, a target date set by unesco.
beijing hiv/aids patients increase 40 percent a year
xinhua news agency, beijing, december 1 (zhao xinpei, li xun) - the beijing health ministry announced the newest figure of hiv/aids carriers in beijing a few days ago: from 1985 to october 2004, an accumulated total of 2,046 hiv/aids cases were reported in beijing and the number is increasing at an average annual rate of 40.6 percent.
the state hiv/aids statistics data showed that the number of hiv/aids carriers reported in beijing is the eighth highest in the nation.
among the 2,046 hiv/aids carriers, 403 are beijing residents, 1,507 are floating population from other parts of the country, 106 are foreigners, and 30 are people with unknown address.
according to analysis, beijing residents contracted hiv/aids mostly through intravenous drug abuse and sexual transmission, the floating population contracted hiv/aids mainly through intravenous drug abuse and blood transfers, while foreigners contracted hiv/aids mainly through sexual transmission.
in order to stop hiv/aids from further spreading, free consultation offices and antibody screening labs have been set up by the center for disease control in the 18 districts and counties in beijing since july 2004 to launch face-to-face consultation, initial blood screening, and epidemiological study. the programs will be gradually expanded to hospitals grade-2 or above across the city.
the beijing health ministry has assigned di tan hospital and you an hospital as designated hospitals for free hiv/aids treatment in beijing. these hospitals are responsible for the clinical portion of the free hiv/aids treatment. the required medicine reagents will be centrally coordinated and purchased by the beijing health ministry and the municipal financial department.
the beijing commission of education has drawn up a free educational policy for hiv/aids carriers and their children, as well as the schooling policy for hiv/aids carriers among teenage students.
at present, grade-2 and above hospitals across the city that are equipped with gynecology and obstetrics wards will assume the responsibilities of free hiv/aids consultation and screening, while di tan hospital and you an hospital will provide antiviral medical treatment for pregnant women.
currently, 1,390 automatic condom vending machines have been installed in some areas at no charge. among intravenous drug addicts, methadone maintenance treatment has been launched and pilot locations for clean needle exchange have been established.
shanghai power generating equipment output and production capacity leap to world best
xinhua news agency, shanghai, december 1 (reporter jiang wei) - with the completion of the trial run of a 660,000-kilowatt power-generating unit, shanghai turbine generator co., ltd, a subsidiary of shanghai electric group, reached its annual production target of 15 million-kilowatt units on the 1st, a date earlier than planned. the achievement thus enabled shanghai to leap to lead the world in both output and production capacity of power plant equipment and fulfilled the wish of several generations of the chinese equipment manufacturing industry.
shanghai electric group is the largest power plant equipment-manufacturing base in china.
with the rapid growth in the demand for power-generating equipment in china in recent years, power generator manufacturers across the country have entered a phase marked by huge growth and major development.
shanghai electric group consolidated the favorable resources of power plant equipment including steam turbines and power plant boilers. after undertaking the production of four million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generating units, it has also acquired production orders for nine heavy-duty fuel-powered electric generating units and three waste heat boilers through a combined bidding.
meanwhile, through an integrated operation, it has further enhanced its business management, technology development, and production efficiency.
at present, shanghai electric group holds 40 percent of the market share for the chinese power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas markets in the middle east, southeast asia, and south america.
this year alone, shanghai turbine generator co., ltd has received a rmb 6 billion yuan sales order for the main engine components of the power generating equipment.
zheng jianhua, president of shanghai electric group, said that the "power shortage" this summer had boosted the demand for power plant equipment across the country. the competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is gradually becoming white-hot.
the group is putting into practice its three objectives of "developing and producing million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generation, gas turbine generating units, and million-kilowatt grade nuclear power" in order to achieve its goal of rising to the world's 500 strongest as soon as possible.
(hong kong, macau, taiwan) hong kong observatory to provide new services for wmo
xinhua news agency, hong kong, december 12 - the hong kong observatory will launch two new services for the "world weather information service" and "severe weather information center" websites hosted by the world meteorological organization, starting december 2.
a spokesman for the observatory said that the two new services are to add a global official weather observation of cloudiness and rain to the "world weather information service" website and a recap function to display the tropical cyclone paths for the past seven days on the "severe weather information center" website.
these two programs are another new service that the hong kong observatory is offering after it started providing the "severe weather information center" with official observation information of heavy rain (including snow) in areas around the world earlier this year.
according to information, the "world weather information service" website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for the world's major cities.
the new service, for the first time, provides global official weather observations with the cloudiness and rain distribution map as its first project introduced.
the weather observation information on the new web page has a wide coverage and a high density, with eight scheduled updates per day.
the new product of the "severe weather information center" website is to provide a recap function for displaying tropical cyclone paths.
the previous design was that once the tropical cyclone dissipated, information including the location of the tropical cyclone would no longer be saved on the website.
however, the public often still wants to obtain related information about the tropical cyclone a few days after it makes landfall.
as a result, the new product will store information on the intensities, locations, and paths of tropical cyclones that have happened in the past seven days so the public and the media can still obtain desired information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated.
world's first bird flu virus h5n1 strain rapid diagnostic kit successfully developed in shantou
xinhua news agency, shantou, december 3 (reporters zhang yiwen, lin juniang) - reporters obtained information from shantou university medical college/the university of hong kong faculty of medicine joint influenza research center that after almost six months of collaboration with xiamen university, they have developed the world's first rapid diagnostic kit for the bird flu virus h5n1 strain.
a confirmation of whether a person has contracted the bird flu virus can be obtained in as little as an hour by testing a specimen from the suspected carrier with this rapid diagnostic method.
according to professor guan yi, director of shantou university/the university of hong kong faculty of medicine joint influenza research center, based on the information available now, bird flu, which is listed as a highly fatal pathogenic virus, has a case fatality rate much higher than the sars virus.
in the past, it would take three to five days or even more than a week to confirm a "suspected" case of virus infection.
the successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technique uses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay techniques. testable specimens include excrement, nasal or throat secretions, intact virus cultivated from chicken embryo, virus isolate, or serum. a confirmation of bird flu virus infection can be reached in as soon as an hour or within two hours at the latest.
the new technique has the characteristics of being simple, convenient, and fast. testing can be conducted at the outbreak site with an accuracy rate of over 90 percent. it can help the early discovery, diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent a widespread and major disaster.

china's largest seawater desalination project begins in zhoushan
xinhua news agency, hangzhou, december 6 (pan yifeng, xu qun) - the largest seawater desalination project ever in china, with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons, will begin in putuo district, zhoushan city of zhejiang province.
for zhoushan residents, who suffer greatly from water shortages, the vast and mighty seawater that has been flowing by their side for hundreds and thousands of years will soon become clear and sweet tap water that runs into tens of thousands of households.
information gathered by reporters from relevant departments showed that hangzhou development center of water treatment technology under the state oceanic administration and liuheng township government in putuo district of zhoushan city signed the cooperation agreement for a 10,000-ton seawater desalination project a few days ago.
the investment for the project is rmb 50 million yuan with a daily fresh water production capacity of 10,000 tons. its treatment scale is the largest among all seawater desalination projects in china thus far. the first stage of the project is expected to be completed next year.
zhoushan city is one of the chinese cities that suffers the most from water shortages.
there are 1,390 islands of varying sizes in the city. on average, each person has 601 cubic meters of fresh water, only 25.4 percent of that of zhejiang province. drinking water has always been a problem that affects the residents' lives in this island city.
for instance, liuheng town in putuo district has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day at a cost of more than rmb 10 yuan per ton.
the reverse osmosis seawater desalination technology developed by hangzhou development center of water treatment technology under the state oceanic administration is a membrane diffusion process powered by pressure and is the focus in today's international seawater desalination research domain.
the relevant leading official of the center said that through the technological enhancement and improvement of equipment inside china, the cost for the reverse osmosis seawater desalination project and its energy consumption have both been lowered.
the cost for each ton of seawater desalination treatment will be further reduced from the existing rmb 5 yuan.
it indicates that the cost for seawater desalination will hopefully approach the price of tap water and industrial use water.

three gorges dam underground power station construction begins soon
xinhua news agency, wuhan, december 8 (reporter shi yongfeng) - december 8. an invitation for a public bid for the principal construction of the underground power station of the three gorges dam is underway for the first time, thus marking the inauguration of the construction project.
the three gorges dam project plans to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydro turbine-generating units with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts. the average annual power generated after the entire unit goes into operation will be 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours.
in order to further develop the power generating potential of the three gorges dam project, a space for the construction of an underground power station was reserved in advance in its initial design.
according to a top official of the yangtze river three gorges project development corp., the underground power station of the three gorges dam is located inside the mountains, to the right side of the great dam. its main structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main powerhouse, tailwater system, vertical shafts, and a 500-kilovolt transformer substation.
six 700,000kw-generator units will be installed in the underground power station.
in this case, the total number of generators installed in the three gorges dam project will be increased from the original 26 to 32 units while the installed capacity will be increased from 18.2 million kilowatts to 22.4 million kilowatts, thus greatly improving the power generating capacity of the three gorges dam project.
flood control is the priority mission for the three gorges dam project.
according to the three gorges reservoir operation adjustment plan, every year before the flood season, the water retention level inside the three gorges reservoir will be operated at the lowered flood control limit level of 145 meters, from its normal 175 meters level.
thus, the construction of the underground power station will increase the water utilization index of the three gorges reservoir, reduce water wastage and increase power-generating capacity in order to maximize the impounding stream peak adjustment period of the power station.
currently, early construction projects of the three gorges dam underground power station, including the digging of branch tunnels and tailwater ditches, as well as the construction of the prop-ups, have begun.
according to sources, the underground power station will be completed and go into operation by the end of 2008.

according to sources, the establishment of any festival that does not require a day off should be approved by the state council.
zheng he was a world-renowned mariner.
in the 28 years between 1405 and 1433, zheng he led more than 200 fleets and close to 30,000 people to cross the vast ocean seven times through southeast asia and the indian ocean to the red sea and africa, sailing more than 300,000 kilometers and visited over 30 countries and regions in asia and africa.
china will hold a series of commemorative activities next year to celebrate the 600th anniversary of zheng he's expedition to the west.
the logo of the commemorative activities was announced in beijing on the 8th.
the logo was made up of a westbound sailboat braving the wind and waves, churning arc-shaped spindrifts in light blue color, and words that say "zheng he's 600th anniversary to the west, 1405-2005."
the designer was yao ying, an art teacher at a high school in xi'an city of shan'xi province.
people in society all urged that china should seize the commemoration of zheng hen's 600th anniversary to the west in 2005 and the opportunity to enhance the education of minors to establish the nautical fair in order to raise people's nautical awareness and their oceanic concepts, to pass on the spirit of the chinese nation, and to intensify education in patriotism.
yao mingde stated that china has over 3 million square kilometers of maritime space and in china's international trade, 90 percent of the goods involved in the transactions are completed through maritime shipping.
china is a big nautical country in the world and not having a nautical fair among all the festivals is wrong.
taiwan province has already established july 11 as the nautical fair.
nautical fairs have been established in more than 10 countries in the world, including the united states, canada, and japan.

experts suggest establishment of news spokesman system for minors in china
xinhua news agency, shanghai, december 13 (reporter liu dan) - the "forum on social education for chinese youth 2004 - the media and the development of minors" that closed on the 13th in shanghai suggested that china should establish a news spokesman system related to the situation of minors to release regular information on the current developmental situation of minors and the issues encountered.

he said he believed that the future iraqi government would be a legitimate government that represents iraqis and that expresses their will.
al-zebari claimed that the coalition forces headed by the united states were asked to stay and provide protection in iraq by the iraqi authorities because the current iraqi interim government cannot control the security situation and eradicate the terrorists and saboteurs.
there is a time limit for the occupation of the coalition forces. according to the united nations resolution, it will end once iraq finishes its political process and a legitimate government is formed.
al-zebari stressed that the new iraq will preserve its arabic and islamic attributes and will abide by the constitution of the arab league.
the iraqis are presented with the opportunity to rebuild their country on a new foundation. iraq will rise again and become an important member of the large arab family that can contribute to its own people.

(international) un warns of rise of global drug-related deaths in 2005
xinhua news agency, vienna, december 17 (reporter song guocheng) - costa, executive director of the united nations office on drug and crime, warned in a press release on the 17th that because of the increase in heroin production in afghanistan, it is expected that the global price of heroin on the black market is going to stabilize and the pureness will increase, thus resulting in the deaths of more drug addicts.
costa has already issued warnings to officials of health and anti-drug agencies in europe and its surrounding countries and called on these countries to pay close attention to the newest trends in afghanistan drug cultivation and international drug-related crimes and to adopt relevant measures.
according to the statistics numbers provided by the united nations office on drug and crime, headquartered in vienna, when the opium cultivation industry in afghanistan was banned in 2001, heroin production in afghanistan dropped by 94 percent and the pureness of black market heroin in europe decreased by 50 percent the following year.
in 2000 and 2002, the number of drug related deaths in europe dropped by 20 percent.
costa said that the area for heroin cultivation in afghanistan increased by 64 percent this year, compared to 2003. heroin production has reached more than 500 tons, higher than the annual transaction amount on the world heroin black market. this trend indicates that the global pureness of the drug will be higher and there will be a corresponding increase in drug-related deaths.
costa believed that afghanistan as a drug source poses a "clear and present danger" to global anti-drug efforts. the increase in the supply of black market heroin implies a "death sentence" for drug addicts.
according to estimates, approximately 100,000 people in the world die from drug overdoses each year.
(international) u.s. army confirms another guantanamo prisoner not enemy-combatant
xinhua news agency, washington, december 20 (reporters pan yunzhao, tan xinmu) - u.s. department of defense navy secretary gordon england said in a press conference at the pentagon on the 20th that an army investigative panel had confirmed that a prisoner at the guantanamo u.s. navy base was not an enemy combatant and would soon be released.
this was the second guantanamo prisoner determined by the u.s. army not to be an enemy combatant.
england said that the pentagon confirmed this prisoner's status a day or two ago. the state department would notify the prisoner's home country and arrange for his release.
nevertheless, he did not reveal the name and nationality of the prisoner and did not explain under what conditions he was captured.
england refused to admit that the department of defense had made a mistake in determining the identity of the guantanamo prisoner.
he stated that the army investigative panel in charge of reviewing the status of the guantanamo prisoners had conducted reviews of 507 prisoners and determined the identities of 230 people; the enemy-combatant status of 228 pf these people was correct.
to date, the united states has released approximately 200 guantanamo prisoners. after their return to their home countries, some of them were released, while a small number of them remain in prison, but at least 12 of them have taken part in fighting the u.s. army again after their release.
currently, 550 suspected members of al-qaeda and the taliban, many of whom were captured during the u.s-afghanistan war, are being locked up at the guantanamo u.s. navy base.
the u.s. government called these people enemy combatants and not pows, thus they are not protected by the geneva convention.
many countries have criticized the united states of detaining their citizens indefinitely while some international organizations also denounce the way the u.s. government handles this matter as a violation of international law.

confronted with the rapid development trend of the internet, the china internet network information center, which manages domain name registration in china, conducted a reevaluation of the four original state domain name top-level nodes this year and made rearrangements for the "cn" domain name top-level nodes according to the evaluation results.
the center decided to situate the state domain name top-level node in shanghai, based on the local internet development level and the qualifications of the accessing unit.
according to sources, at present, there are 45,000 "cn" domain names in shanghai, an internet user popularity rate of 26.6 percent. its internet popularity rate and usage level are both the highest in the country.
regions in eastern china neighboring shanghai have 130,000 "cn" domain names and 230,000 websites. their development levels are also among the highest of the country.
as a result, shanghai was chosen as the first node in the rearrangement plan.
china becomes world's largest hard alloy production country
xinhua news agency, nanchang, december 22 (reporters yang yuanyuan, li xingwen) - china's hard alloy industry has developed rapidly in recent years. its annual output is more than one third of the world's total hard alloy output. from the production scale and output standpoint, china has become the world's largest hard alloy production country, with a whole array of alloy varieties and the ability to produce most of the products.
the information above was gathered by the reporters on the 22nd, at the china ganzhou tungsten industry development strategy symposium that is in progress.
hard alloy is known as "industrial tooth." it is used as cutting tools, high-pressure tools, and machineries for mining and road construction because of its extremely high hardness and wear-proof capability. the development of the hard alloy industry plays an important role in the entire growth of the tungsten industry.
according to information, china's alloy industry started in the 1950s of the 20th century, from the ground up. through continuous development, it has made outstanding achievements so far.
in the early 1980s of the 20th century, when the world annual hard alloy output was at 25,000 tons, the annual hard alloy output of china was approximately 5,000 tons. entering the 21st century, the world annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while china's output has increased rapidly to 15,000 tons, constituting more than one-third of world's hard alloy production.
china's hard alloy export has also achieved significant improvements.
in 1986, china's alloy export volume was only 100 tons; while in 2003, the export volume reached 2,500 tons. it is expected that this year's export volume will be more than 3,000 tons, accounting for one third of the world's hard alloy market circulation capacity as in its output. the annual net profits of hard alloy have increased from less than u.s. $4 million in the past to u.s. $70 million nowadays.
asian development bank awards loan to support shanxi coal bed and coalfield gas power generation
xinhua news agency, beijing, december 23 (reporter jiang guocheng) - the reporter gathered information from the asian development bank's china office on the 23rd that the bank has recently approved a us $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern shanxi province, powered by methane produced during mining.
the coal bed gas development demonstration project will utilize the newest technology to increase the output of coal bed gas and coalfield gas to supply the fuel for a soon-to-be constructed 120,000-kilowatt power plant.
according to the project plan, when the project is completed in 2008, it will supply approximately 90,000 residential, industrial, and commercial users with at least 166 million m3 of coal bed gas per year.
the project will benefit about 410,000 people in the jincheng area.
the total coal output of shanxi constitutes about one third of the total national output.
the project is estimated to cost u.s. $237 million. the japan bank for international cooperation will provide u.s. $20 million, while china construction bank will provide u.s. $37.86 million.
the jincheng municipal government and two local mining/industrial groups will provide a total of u.s. $61.24 million of capital.
the u.s. trade and development agency also awarded a grant of u.s. $500,000 to the project.
through in-mine drilling from the ground surface, the methane obtained from the mineshaft after it is built is called coal bed gas, while that produced during underground mining is called coalfield gas.
methane is a highly explosive gas and has to be released in advance during the mining process in order to guarantee the safety of the work environment.
the elimination, collection, and utilization of methane will lower the release of greenhouse gas and is useful in slowing down global warming and climate change.
the greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide.
the substitution of coal with methane will increase the consumption of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and make the air cleaner.
hassing, senior officer of the asian development bank stated that the project will hopefully provide approximately 4.5 million tons of emissions reductions of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.
(international) israel museum's most precious exhibit counterfeit
xinhua news agency, jerusalem, december 24 - james snyder, director of the israel museum, stated on the 24th that the museum's most precious exhibit, the ivory pomegranate, was confirmed as a fake a few days ago.
the ivory pomegranate was once believed to be the only artifact discovered from the first temple, during king solomon's era.
snyder stated in a declaration that the israeli authorities had conducted a detailed examination on the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate.
experts discovered that the relic should belong to the bronze age and is considerably older than the first jewish temple's era.
a line inscribed in hebrew lettering on the ivory pomegranate reads, "belonging to the temple of the lord (yahweh), holy to the priests."
the inscription was verified to be added afterwards.
the israel museum spent u.s. $550,000 to buy this ivory pomegranate from an anonymous collector in the 1980s of last century.
archaeologists and antiquity experts once believed that it was a treasure mounted on the top of a priest's scepter in the first temple, and the only relic left from that time.
snyder claimed that before they bought the ivory pomegranate, israeli archaeologist nahman avigad and other experts had authenticated the relic.
according to haaretz daily, avigad only used a magnifying glass to do a cursory check on the relic at that time.
avigad personally denied such allegations.
in recent months, israeli police have discovered three major antiquity forgery cases successively and have subpoenaed several hundred people.
during their investigation, the police and the antiquities authority discovered serendipitously that the ivory pomegranate is a forgery.
the police will file charges against some of the people involved in the case next week.
in the 10th century b.c., the jewish king solomon built the first temple at present-day temple mount to store holy items including the ark of the covenant and noah's ark, which were later destroyed.
shenzhen enforces "middle-water" usage in buildings and small districts
xinhua news agency, guangzhou, december 26 - shenzhen will enforce "middle- water" usage in some larger-scale buildings and small districts as a major measure in establishing "water-saving style" cities. at present, relevant specifications and regulations for the middle-water plan are being drawn up.
middle-water mainly refers to non-drinking water from treated city and daily wastewater that has reached a certain water quality, and can be reused in certain areas.
its water quality is between tap water and wastewater that goes down the drainage.
in general, it is widely used for flushing toilets, watering gardens and farmlands, cleaning roads, washing cars, and supplementing the water in city fountains and cooling facilities.
a study by shenzhen water works showed that in the mid 1990s of the 20th century, more than 70 buildings in shenzhen were equipped with the "middle-water"-recycling system. however, the cost of recycling for "middle-water" was too high due to technological, design, and management factors, thus forcing the construction unit to stop using it.
only rmb 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of extra investment will be needed to install the "middle-water"-treatment system in order for these pipelines to perform their functions properly.
if the more than 70 existing sets of "middle-water" pipelines are being used, according to the present daily usage of 500 tons of "middle-water" in small districts, it will save 35,000 tons of tap water for shenzhen per day.
according to information, the shenzhen "middle-water"-recycling project will start with the remodeling of the more than 70 existing buildings that have the "middle-water"-recycling system. after summarizing the experience, the project will be further expanded.
meanwhile, shenzhen water works will draw up specifications for the "middle-water"-plan with urban planning and development departments as soon as possible and will enforce "middle-water" usage in some larger-scale buildings.
the treated "middle-water" will first be used in watering the trees in and around the city.
27 zhejiang tourists escape tsunami
xinhua news agency, hangzhou, december 27 (reporters feng yuan, qu lingyan, hu zuohua) - a 27-person tour group to phuket island, thailand, from zhejiang escaped unscathed in a life and death race with the tsunami.
